# Project Governance

This document defines project governance for the project.

## Voting

The project employs "organization voting" to ensure no single organization can dominate the project.

Individuals not associated with or employed by a company or organization are allowed one organization vote.

Each company or organization (regardless of the number of maintainers associated with or employed by that company/organization) receives one organization vote.

In other words, if two maintainers are employed by Company X, two by Company Y, two by Company Z, and one maintainer is an un-affiliated individual, a total of four "organization votes" are possible; one for X, one for Y, one for Z, and one for the un-affiliated individual.

Any maintainer from an organization may cast the vote for that organization.

Maintainers should indicate their yes/no vote on that issue or PR, and after a suitable period of time, the votes will be tallied and the outcome noted.

## Changes in Maintainership

New maintainers are proposed by an existing maintainer and are elected by a 2/3 majority organization vote from other maintainers with the relevant area(s) of expertise.

Maintainer status expires after 1 year but a request to self-renew can be made within 1 month of expiry.

Maintainers can be removed by a 2/3 majority organization vote.

## Github Project Administration

The MAINTAINERS.md file in this repository contains a set of OPA project maintainers and their area(s) of expertise. Maintainers will be added to the GitHub organization and added to the GitHub team(s) associated with repositories or areas of expertise that they maintain (e.g., `opa-maintainers`, `gatekeeper-maintainers`, etc.)

## Conflict Resolution for Technical Decisions

If a technical decision cannot be reached due to a dispute between two or more maintainers, an organization vote will be held by the maintainers with the relevant area(s) of expertise following the rules described above.

## Changes in Governance

All changes in Governance require a 2/3 majority organization vote.

## Other Changes

Unless specified above, all other changes to the project require a 2/3 majority organization vote from maintainers with relevant area(s) of expertise.

Additionally, any maintainer may request that any change require a 2/3 majority organization vote from maintainers with relevant area(s) of expertise.
