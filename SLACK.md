# OPA Slack Guidelines v1.0

The [CNCF Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
applies in all areas in addition to these rules:

## Channel Spamming

Outside of the issue queues, Slack is our best communication medium for
projects. Please keep your messages on topic for each channel, and please use
the appropriate channel. Please do not cross-post. Spamming channels with
unsolicited or frequent messages is not allowed.

## Vendor Advertisements

This workspace is intended for conversations related to Open Policy Agent (OPA)
projects. Please do not use OPA Slack to advertise proprietary vendor products,
services, webinars, blogs, etc.

## Reporting a Problem

Please report issues to Torin Sandall (torin@styra.com or @tsandall) or Amye
Scavarda Parin (amye@linuxfoundation.org).

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. If a
community member engages in unacceptable behavior, an admin may take any action
deemed appropriate, up to and including a warning or temporary 30 day ban, along
with a permanent ban for repeated violation of these guidelines. Admins may also
remove content that violates the above guidelines.
