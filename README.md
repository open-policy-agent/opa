Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack.

OPA is proud to be a graduated project in the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) landscape. For details read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2021/02/04/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-open-policy-agent-graduation/).

## Get started with OPA

- Write your first Rego policy with the [Rego Playground](https://play.openpolicyagent.org) or use it to share your work with others for feedback and support. Have a look at the [Access Control examples](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/?example-group=access-control) if you're not sure where to start.
- Install the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tsandall.opa) to get started locally with live diagnostics, debugging and formatting. See [Editor and IDE Support](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/edge/editor-and-ide-support/) for other supported editors.
- Go to the [OPA Documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) to
  learn about the Rego language as well as how to deploy and integrate OPA.
- Check out the learning resources in the [Learning Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/ecosystem/learning-rego/) section of the ecosystem directory.
- Follow the [Running OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#running-opa) instructions to get started with the OPA CLI locally.
- See [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openpolicyagent/opa/tags/) for container images and the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases) for binaries.
- Check out the [OPA Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16QV6gvLDOV3I0_guPC3_19g6jHkEg3X9xqMYgtoCKrs/edit?usp=sharing) to see a high-level snapshot of OPA features in-progress and planned.

## Want to talk about OPA or get support?

- Join the [OPA Slack](https://slack.openpolicyagent.org) to talk to other OPA users and maintainers. See `#help` for support.
- Check out the [Community Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/open-policy-agent/discussions) to ask questions.

## Interested to learn what others are doing with OPA?

- Browse community projects on the [OPA Ecosystem Directory](http://openpolicyagent.org/ecosystem/) - don't forget to [list your own](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/tree/main/docs#opa-ecosystem)!
- Check out the [ADOPTERS.md](./ADOPTERS.md) file for a list of production adopters. Does your organization use OPA in production? Support the OPA project by submitting a PR to add your organization to the list with a short description of your OPA use cases!

## Want to integrate OPA?

- See the high-level [Go SDK](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/integration/#integrating-with-the-go-sdk) or the low-level Go API
  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego)
  to integrate OPA with services written in Go.
- See the [REST API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/rest-api.html)
  reference to integrate OPA with services written in other languages.
- See the [integration docs](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/integration/) for more options.

## Want to contribute to OPA?

- Read the [Contributing Guide](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/contributing/) to learn how to make your first contribution.
- Use [#contributors](https://openpolicyagent.slack.com/archives/C02L1TLPN59) in Slack to talk to other contributors and OPA maintainers.
- File a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues) to request features or report bugs.

## How does OPA work?

OPA gives you a high-level declarative language to author and enforce policies
across your stack.

With OPA, you define _rules_ that govern how your system should behave. These
rules exist to answer questions like:

- Can user X call operation Y on resource Z?
- What clusters should workload W be deployed to?
- What tags must be set on resource R before it's created?

You integrate services with OPA so that these kinds of policy decisions do not
have to be _hardcoded_ in your service. Services integrate with OPA by
executing _queries_ when policy decisions are needed.

When you query OPA for a policy decision, OPA evaluates the rules and data
(which you give it) to produce an answer. The policy decision is sent back as
the result of the query.

For example, in a simple API authorization use case:

- You write rules that allow (or deny) access to your service APIs.
- Your service queries OPA when it receives API requests.
- OPA returns allow (or deny) decisions to your service.
- Your service _enforces_ the decisions by accepting or rejecting requests accordingly.

For concrete examples of how to integrate OPA with systems like [Kubernetes](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/kubernetes-admission-control.html), [Terraform](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/terraform.html), [Docker](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/docker-authorization.html), [SSH](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/ssh-and-sudo-authorization.html), and more, see [openpolicyagent.org](https://www.openpolicyagent.org).
