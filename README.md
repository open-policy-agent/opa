Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack.

OPA is proud to be a graduated project in the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) landscape. For details read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2021/02/04/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-open-policy-agent-graduation/).

## How does OPA work?

OPA gives you a high-level declarative language to author and enforce policies
across your stack.

With OPA, you define _rules_ that govern how your system should behave. These
rules exist to answer questions like:

* Can user X call operation Y on resource Z?
* What clusters should workload W be deployed to?
* What tags must be set on resource R before it's created?

You integrate services with OPA so that these kinds of policy decisions do not
have to be *hardcoded* in your service. Services integrate with OPA by
executing _queries_ when policy decisions are needed.

When you query OPA for a policy decision, OPA evaluates the rules and data
(which you give it) to produce an answer. The policy decision is sent back as
the result of the query.

For example, in a simple API authorization use case:

* You write rules that allow (or deny) access to your service APIs.
* Your service queries OPA when it receives API requests.
* OPA returns allow (or deny) decisions to your service.
* Your service _enforces_ the decisions by accepting or rejecting requests accordingly.

For concrete examples of how to integrate OPA with systems like [Kubernetes](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/kubernetes-admission-control.html), [Terraform](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/terraform.html), [Docker](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/docker-authorization.html), [SSH](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/ssh-and-sudo-authorization.html), and more, see [openpolicyagent.org](https://www.openpolicyagent.org).
