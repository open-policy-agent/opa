<!-- Thanks for opening an issue to request a feature or file a bug!
If you provide some basic information, it helps us address problems faster. -->

## What functionality would you like to add or improve?
<!--
A clear and concise description of how you envision this new or improved functionality working.
Is there something challenging or frustrating about OPA that you are trying to improve?
Do you want OPA to integrate with another project or tool?
-->

## Describe the ideal solution
<!--
In the ideal scenario, there are more than enough resources to solve any problem. Describe what this solution would look like if the resources were available.
-->

## Describe a "Good Enough" solution
<!--
In a more realistic world, we have limited time and resources to solve a problem. Describe what a minimum viable solution would look like that still satisfies the requirements. Think about what is a must-have and what is a nice-to-have; now list out the must-haves. Is there an alternate solution that would work just as well?
-->

## Additional Context
<!--
Add in additional information that would help. Do you have links to similar solutions, screenshots of a problem, or mockups of a solution?
