<!--

Thanks for submitting a PR to OPA!

Before pressing 'Create pull request' please read the checklist below.

* All code changes should be accompanied with tests. If you are not
modifying any tests, just provide a short explanation of why updates
to tests are not necessary. In addition to helping catch bugs, tests
are extremely helpful in providing _context_ that explains how your
changes can be used.

* All changes to public APIs **must** be accompanied with
docs. Examples of public APIs include built-in functions,
config fields, and of course, exported Go types/functions/constants/etc.

* Commit messages should explain _why_ you made the changes, not what
you changed. Use active voice. Keep the subject line under 50
characters or so.

* All commits must be signed off by the author. If you are not
familiar with signing off, see CONTRIBUTING.md below.
