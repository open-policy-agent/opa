# Decision Log Plugin

The decision log plugin is responsible for gathering decision events from multiple sources and upload them to a service.
[This plugin is highly configurable](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/configuration/#decision-logs), allowing 
the user to decide when to upload, drop or proxy a logged event. Each configuration can be dynamically updated while OPA is running.

Events are uploaded in gzip compressed JSON array's at a user defined interval. This can either be triggered periodically
or manually through the SDK. The size of the gzip compressed JSON array is limited by `upload_size_limit_bytes`.

## Buffer Type

There are two buffer implementations that can be selected by setting `decision_logs.reporting.buffer_type`, defaults to `size`

### Event Buffer

* `decision_logs.reporting.buffer_type=event`

As events are logged each event is encoded and saved in a buffer. When an upload is triggered, all the events currently
in the buffer are uploaded in chunks (limited by `upload_size_limit_bytes`). The oldest events will drop if the buffer
is full, the limit can be configured by changing `buffer_size_limit_events`.

Pros:
* Compressing only on upload keeps the event and JSON array buffers separate so they don't have to be in sync.
* Individual events can be dropped quicker without having to decompress the events.
* Using a channel as a buffer allows events to be written to the buffer concurrently.

Cons:
* Upload will be slower as the events need to be compressed.
* A buffer limit has to be set, unlimited size isn't allowed.

        end
    end
    package -. POST .-> service
    classDef large font-size:20pt;
    
```

### Size Buffer

* `decision_logs.reporting.buffer_type=size`

As events are logged they are encoded and compressed into a JSON Array before being added to the buffer. When an upload 
is triggered the current buffer is emptied, uploading each JSON Array of events as chunks. By default, the buffer is an
unlimited size but if `buffer_size_limit_bytes` is configured the oldest events will be dropped.

Pros:
* Uploads are quicker because each event is already encoded and compressed.
* The local memory in bytes of the buffer can be limited.

Cons:
* Events can flow between the encoder and buffer requiring a heavy use of locks.
* Dropping an individual event requires decompressing an entire array of events.
* Adding events to the buffer is slower as compression happens on write.

        end
        subgraph Buffer [Buffer]
            B["[[event, event, ...], [event, event, ...]]"]
        end
        package --> Buffer
        Buffer --> Encoder
        
    end
    Buffer -. POST .-> service
    classDef large font-size:20pt;
    
```

## Triggers

There are three trigger options that can be selected by setting `decision_logs.reporting.trigger`, defaults to
`periodic`.

### Periodic

Uploads are purposely delayed by number of seconds randomly selected between a minimum and maximum. The default delay
range is 300-600 seconds, this can be configured by setting `decision_logs.reporting.min_delay_seconds` and
`decision_logs.reporting.max_delay_seconds`.

It is recommended to use this trigger mode to prevent overloading the service with upload requests.

### Immediate

As soon as enough events are received that fill the buffer the plugin will trigger an upload. When using this
trigger mode the `min_delay_seconds` cannot be set as it can be considered to be 0. The `max_delay_seconds` is still
configurable in case not enough events are received to hit the upload limit. Configure `max_delay_seconds` to be larger
than the average amount of time it takes to fill up the buffer.

It is recommended to use this trigger mode if you want a constant stream of incoming data. Minimizes amount of events
dropped during peak traffic hours.

### Manual

This option can only be used when using OPA as a Go package. The OPA Go package exposes as method
called [Plugin.Trigger](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa@v1.3.0/v1/plugins/logs#Plugin.Trigger)
that can be called to trigger an upload.
