This change is however not isolated to those, but\nupdates the `String()` implementation of all AST node types (term values\nand policy components). This change also lays the groundwork for migrating\nOPA to the `json/v2` package once that's stable. The `json/v2` package\nprovides low-level functions for zero alloc marshalling via appenders — and\nwell, here they are. The appenders here should be usable for that purpose with\nonly a few tweaks needed for the few cases where our `String()` implementations\naren't also valid JSON.\n\nCreating perfectly sized buffers requires knowing the expected length beforehand.\nIn order to do this, each component now implements not only `encoding.AppendText`\nbut a new custom `StringLengther` interface, which allows asking any AST node about\nits `StringLength()` before `make`ing a buffer of that length.\n\nWe could definitely consider adding these to e.g. the `Value` or `Node` interfaces,\nbut I've left that out of this PR as it's an easy thing to do later should we want\nto, and I guess there's always some concerns about changing public interfaces even\nwhen they're not meant to be implemented by external code.\n\nWhile no `Value` appenders allocate and almost none of the policy appenders do either,\none notable exception is `Module` when there are annotations present, as they are\na bit of a (YAML) special case. It's doable, but as serializing full modules isn't\non a hot path anywhere, I have chosen to defer that work to the future.\n\nSigned-off-by: Anders Eknert <anders.eknert@apple.com>","github_username":"anderseknert","author_date":"2026-01-08T09:14:53Z"},"8c9e8b4c046d1a48f08e6c7cddf73b528dbd8a7c":{"message":"perf(ast): optimize Set.Union\n\nUse direct iteration and pre-allocation instead of Foreach + Add.\nPre-allocate with max(|A|, |B|), striking a balance between disjoint\nand overlapping set scenarios.\n\nThis eliminates:\n- Unnecessary sorting via sortedKeys() implicitly through Foreach()\n- Repeated sortGuard resets implicitly through Add()\n- Over-allocation for overlapping sets\n\nAdded benchmarks.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ville Vesilehto <ville@vesilehto.fi>","github_username":"thevilledev","author_date":"2026-01-03T09:05:19Z"},"f75f2f59caaa9554d04b5a02af5109d0a63fe9b0":{"message":"perf(topdown): optimize object builtins (#8175)\n\nOptimize builtinObjectUnionN, builtinObjectRemove, and\nbuiltinObjectFilter to pre-allocate result objects, avoiding\nincremental reallocations.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ville Vesilehto <ville@vesilehto.fi>","github_username":"thevilledev","author_date":"2026-01-07T22:24:09Z"},"b2043cb45bcd721b00b98097fd8a7351e5050a91":{"message":"Wrap agent startup hook commands with bash -c (#8189)\n\nUpdated sessionStart hook commands to explicitly use bash -c wrapper.\nThis improves compatibility across different environments where default\nshell may vary.\n\nSigned-off-by: Charlie Egan <charlie_egan@apple.com>","github_username":"charlieegan3","author_date":"2026-01-07T10:27:35Z"},"0b0c0ee4b448ae09604b6aa2efa7217db38754c4":{"message":"perf(topdown): fast paths for array.reverse (#8177)\n\nAvoid unnecessary allocations in builtinArrayReverse for trivial cases:\n- Empty arrays return ast.InternedEmptyArray directly\n- Single-element arrays return the original operand unchanged\n\nThis follows the same pattern used in builtinArrayConcat and\nbuiltinArraySlice for handling edge cases.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ville Vesilehto <ville@vesilehto.fi>","github_username":"thevilledev","author_date":"2026-01-06T20:24:14Z"},"34bd4c12f1da37afb1d75e8a28269b8e23051ba2":{"message":"chore: Switch to maintained yaml library\n\nSigned-off-by: Manuel Rüger <manuel@rueg.eu>","github_username":"mrueg","author_date":"2026-01-06T00:16:15Z"},"3d49f4506bdfeed1e9f90db991a823b6b347ac69":{"message":"perf(ast): optimize Set.Intersect and Set.Diff (#8167)\n\nBuild result sets directly using newset() and insert() instead of\ncollecting terms into an intermediate slice and eventually passing\nto NewSet().

For Regal's\nembedded bundle, loading it from memory would previously take 16\nms on my laptop, and now it takes 9 ms. There are other things\nin this process that could be concurrent too, like JSON unmarshalling\nof multiple data files. But starting with parsing modules.\n\nThis PR adds `errgroup` as a direct dependency (previously indirect)\nas it is a nicer way to work with wait groups, and one that can be\nuseful elsewhere in the codebase (like in the compiler).\n\nAlso, and as usual, went off on a bit of a tangent refactoring code\nrelated to the bundle build process, and made sure to use some common\nhelpers in code where available.\n\nSigned-off-by: Anders Eknert <anders.eknert@apple.com>","github_username":"anderseknert","author_date":"2025-11-21T07:42:43Z"},"3882d813924a3cf3f24fe29d04d9d5bd535aba08":{"message":"build(deps): bump golang.org/x/crypto from 0.43.0 to 0.45.0 in /e2e (#8066)\n\nBumps [golang.org/x/crypto](https://github.com/golang/crypto) from 0.43.0 to 0.45.0.\n- [Commits](https://github.com/golang/crypto/compare/v0.43.0...v0.45.0)\n\n---\nupdated-dependencies:\n- dependency-name: golang.org/x/crypto\n  dependency-version: 0.45.0\n  dependency-type: indirect\n...\n\nSigned-off-by: dependabot[bot] <support@github.com>\nCo-authored-by: dependabot[bot] <49699333+dependabot[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>","github_username":"dependabot[bot]","author_date":"2025-11-20T20:09:46Z"},"d198154dd6b159def4586cc475b658e6ab06d176":{"message":"build(deps): bump golang.org/x/crypto from 0.43.0 to 0.45.0 (#8065)\n\nBumps [golang.org/x/crypto](https://github.com/golang/crypto) from 0.43.0 to 0.45.0.\n- [Commits](https://github.com/golang/crypto/compare/v0.43.0...v0.45.0)\n\n---\nupdated-dependencies:\n- dependency-name: golang.org/x/crypto\n  dependency-version: 0.45.0\n  dependency-type: indirect\n...\n\nSigned-off-by: dependabot[bot] <support@github.com>\nCo-authored-by: dependabot[bot] <49699333+dependabot[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>","github_username":"dependabot[bot]","author_date":"2025-11-20T18:13:06Z"},"015175c08a1fecf7a1a21e96e804fc4394e748f8":{"message":"docs: Make iteration content flow better (#8064)\n\nAlso condense the main intro on this page.\n\nThis has been done in response to https://openpolicyagent.slack.com/archives/C08V59T3NAF/p1763518441971569\n\nSigned-off-by: Charlie Egan <charlie_egan@apple.com>","github_username":"charlieegan3","author_date":"2025-11-20T14:18:06Z"},"f34b921a8cb5728b1a8e1b7bcfcec6870971c869":{"message":"fix: support custom builtins in CompileModulesWithOpt (#8061)\n\nSigned-off-by: Sebastian Spaink <sebastianspaink@gmail.com>","github_username":"sspaink","author_date":"2025-11-19T15:59:49Z"},"f2f0ef080cb1dd41cf902b8531a4ffbf80c92067":{"message":"inmem: allow passing triggers (AST) data without conversion (#7959)\n\nFixes #7958\n\nSigned-off-by: Anders Eknert <anders@eknert.com>","github_username":"anderseknert","author_date":"2025-11-19T13:04:00Z"},"3188e04a57d85aa1f7861a92dd61eb5dca5a2ffa":{"message":"Use `sync.Pool` for eval func objects (#8054)\n\nThese did not show up in escape analysis as they weren't pointers.\nI guess you could say they... escaped the analysis.
