But while it uses some fairly advanced\nlogic for complex patch operations, it doesn't perform all that\ngreat on simple ones. This is a first and pretty basic attempt\nto improve that somewhat by picking the most low-hangig performance\nfruits, like avoiding repeated allocations of temporary term pointers.\n\nThe main allocation source is the creation of EditTree's, and this\nremains a problem. I have created a sync pool but only managed to\nget the outermost edit tree to recycle, as I found it really hard\nto track where it's safe to release those created in the deeply\nnested calls. Additionally, I managed to trigger stack overflows\ntrying to recycle child trees, so there seems to be some circular\nrefs? Or I just did something wrong.\n\nIf someone wants to look into this and pick up where\nI left, that'd be great!\n\n- Add InternedIntRange for testing, primarily\n- Intern keys used in json.patch patches\n- Clean up json.X built-in benchmarks\n- Reduce allocations in edit tree function\n- Avoid using intermediate data structures\n  for JSON patches\n- Some unrelated interning fixes to reduce noise\n  in tests and benchmarks (e.g. do less stuff in\n  var inits)\n\nSelected benchmark that I used while working on this:\n\n**Before**\n```\nBenchmarkJSONPatchAddShallowScalar/object-10-16    147853      8008 ns/op    9667 B/op    206 allocs/op\nBenchmarkJSONPatchAddShallowScalar/array-10-16     201704      5889 ns/op    7256 B/op    173 allocs/op\nBenchmarkJSONPatchAddShallowScalar/set-10-16       182566      6733 ns/op    8103 B/op    156 allocs/op\n```\n\n**After**\n```\nBenchmarkJSONPatchAddShallowScalar/object-10-16    197414      6066 ns/op    7256 B/op    133 allocs/op\nBenchmarkJSONPatchAddShallowScalar/array-10-16     278121      4427 ns/op    5285 B/op    100 allocs/op\nBenchmarkJSONPatchAddShallowScalar/set-10-16       233884      4839 ns/op    6243 B/op    113 allocs/op\n```\n\nSigned-off-by: Anders Eknert <anders.eknert@apple.com>","github_username":"anderseknert","author_date":"2026-02-10T20:57:12Z"},"bec6edf1ee59c042ebc53d3ffe45cf8cae6ea5ce":{"message":"docs: Add examples to glob.match built in documentation (#8252)\n\n\n\nSigned-off-by: Sibasis Padhi <sibasis.padhi@gmail.com>","github_username":"sibasispadhi","author_date":"2026-02-10T18:38:55Z"},"83627c62a07bc9917be610d214c6fa524f487be0":{"message":"runtime: add custom storage backend registration API (#8303)\n\nImplements RegisterStorageBackend() to allow Go module users to inject custom\nstorage implementations during early-stage package init (hardcoded at build time).\n\nPreviously this was only possible through params.StoreBuilder which required\ndirect SDK usage.\n\nKey changes:\n- Add RegisterStorageBackend() and StorageBackendBuilder type in v1/runtime\n- Modify storage initialization to check registered backends\n\nFixes #8277\n\nSigned-off-by: alex60217101990 <alex6021710@gmail.com>","github_username":"alex60217101990","author_date":"2026-02-10T12:37:33Z"},"037c247b73757589c90dd5733e3ac0127ba684fb":{"message":"compiler: Smarter template string rewriting (#8310)\n\nAvoid wrapping expressions in comprehensions if they are known\nto be defined.

(#8192)\n\nSome work I did during the holidays as part of improving the performance\nof interpolated strings. This change is however not isolated to those, but\nupdates the `String()` implementation of all AST node types (term values\nand policy components). This change also lays the groundwork for migrating\nOPA to the `json/v2` package once that's stable. The `json/v2` package\nprovides low-level functions for zero alloc marshalling via appenders — and\nwell, here they are. The appenders here should be usable for that purpose with\nonly a few tweaks needed for the few cases where our `String()` implementations\naren't also valid JSON.\n\nCreating perfectly sized buffers requires knowing the expected length beforehand.\nIn order to do this, each component now implements not only `encoding.AppendText`\nbut a new custom `StringLengther` interface, which allows asking any AST node about\nits `StringLength()` before `make`ing a buffer of that length.\n\nWe could definitely consider adding these to e.g. the `Value` or `Node` interfaces,\nbut I've left that out of this PR as it's an easy thing to do later should we want\nto, and I guess there's always some concerns about changing public interfaces even\nwhen they're not meant to be implemented by external code.\n\nWhile no `Value` appenders allocate and almost none of the policy appenders do either,\none notable exception is `Module` when there are annotations present, as they are\na bit of a (YAML) special case. It's doable, but as serializing full modules isn't\non a hot path anywhere, I have chosen to defer that work to the future.\n\nSigned-off-by: Anders Eknert <anders.eknert@apple.com>","github_username":"anderseknert","author_date":"2026-01-08T09:14:53Z"},"8c9e8b4c046d1a48f08e6c7cddf73b528dbd8a7c":{"message":"perf(ast): optimize Set.Union\n\nUse direct iteration and pre-allocation instead of Foreach + Add.\nPre-allocate with max(|A|, |B|), striking a balance between disjoint\nand overlapping set scenarios.\n\nThis eliminates:\n- Unnecessary sorting via sortedKeys() implicitly through Foreach()\n- Repeated sortGuard resets implicitly through Add()\n- Over-allocation for overlapping sets\n\nAdded benchmarks.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ville Vesilehto <ville@vesilehto.fi>","github_username":"thevilledev","author_date":"2026-01-03T09:05:19Z"},"f75f2f59caaa9554d04b5a02af5109d0a63fe9b0":{"message":"perf(topdown): optimize object builtins (#8175)\n\nOptimize builtinObjectUnionN, builtinObjectRemove, and\nbuiltinObjectFilter to pre-allocate result objects, avoiding\nincremental reallocations.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ville Vesilehto <ville@vesilehto.fi>","github_username":"thevilledev","author_date":"2026-01-07T22:24:09Z"},"b2043cb45bcd721b00b98097fd8a7351e5050a91":{"message":"Wrap agent startup hook commands with bash -c (#8189)\n\nUpdated sessionStart hook commands to explicitly use bash -c wrapper.\nThis improves compatibility across different environments where default\nshell may vary.\n\nSigned-off-by: Charlie Egan <charlie_egan@apple.com>","github_username":"charlieegan3","author_date":"2026-01-07T10:27:35Z"},"0b0c0ee4b448ae09604b6aa2efa7217db38754c4":{"message":"perf(topdown): fast paths for array.reverse (#8177)\n\nAvoid unnecessary allocations in builtinArrayReverse for trivial cases:\n- Empty arrays return ast.InternedEmptyArray directly\n- Single-element arrays return the original operand unchanged\n\nThis follows the same pattern used in builtinArrayConcat and\nbuiltinArraySlice for handling edge cases.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ville Vesilehto <ville@vesilehto.fi>","github_username":"thevilledev","author_date":"2026-01-06T20:24:14Z"},"34bd4c12f1da37afb1d75e8a28269b8e23051ba2":{"message":"chore: Switch to maintained yaml library\n\nSigned-off-by: Manuel Rüger <manuel@rueg.eu>","github_username":"mrueg","author_date":"2026-01-06T00:16:15Z"},"3d49f4506bdfeed1e9f90db991a823b6b347ac69":{"message":"perf(ast): optimize Set.Intersect and Set.Diff (#8167)\n\nBuild result sets directly using newset() and insert() instead of\ncollecting terms into an intermediate slice and eventually passing\nto NewSet().
