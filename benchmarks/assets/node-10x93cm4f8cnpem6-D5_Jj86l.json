This is accomplished by tweaking\nexisting walk/visitor implementations where appropriate, and by\nintroducing a new visitor type that while more limited, is able\nto perform much better where it can be used. Most impressive of\nthe improvements here is the new `WalkRules` implementation, as\nthe benchmark included in this change shows. The most impactful\nchange is however the improved use of the various `VarVisitor`s\nused during the compilation process.\n\nCompiling the Regal bundle:\n\n**OPA v1.11.0 (main)**\n```\n67207511 ns/op  42652069 B/op    1032387 allocs/op\n```\n\n**Now**\n```\n62502125 ns/op  35918354 B/op     929634 allocs/op\n```\n\nSigned-off-by: Anders Eknert <anders.eknert@apple.com>","github_username":"anderseknert","author_date":"2025-11-26T19:34:27Z"},"8ae1cf83e96e3faa7c413bb6d36be443193f1848":{"message":"build(deps): bump node-forge from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2 in /docs\n\nBumps [node-forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2.\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)\n- [Commits](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/compare/v1.3.1...v1.3.2)\n\n---\nupdated-dependencies:\n- dependency-name: node-forge\n  dependency-version: 1.3.2\n  dependency-type: indirect\n...\n\nSigned-off-by: dependabot[bot] <support@github.com>","github_username":"dependabot[bot]","author_date":"2025-11-26T22:11:23Z"},"76091fd2b7301632523945847c5a545800165be9":{"message":"Prepare v1.12.0 development (#8077)\n\nSigned-off-by: Johan Fylling <johan.dev@fylling.se>","github_username":"johanfylling","author_date":"2025-11-26T13:55:41Z"},"45cbfa1d83841971d0db96b7803b5aeeae91020e":{"message":"Prepare v1.11.0 release (#8076)\n\nSigned-off-by: Johan Fylling <johan.dev@fylling.se>","github_username":"johanfylling","author_date":"2025-11-26T13:01:54Z"},"36590cd7665d0650eb12d4ec0818db0007a514b6":{"message":"deps: bump wasmtime-go v37 -> v39\n\nSigned-off-by: Stephan Renatus <stephan.renatus@gmail.com>","github_username":"srenatus","author_date":"2025-11-26T09:49:30Z"},"545de92907b1edb9a2675d7b4aa49d47f733a84e":{"message":"workflow: add 'Benchmarks' workflow\n\nFor every merged PR, we'll run all benchmarks, record the results, and feed them\ninto git's `benchmarks` branch.

improvements (#8028)\n\nWhile we can't use interned `Term`s in the parser (mutable), we\ncan use interned `Value`s (immutable) and put in those terms. Seeing\nhow often we would allocate a new `Value` for e.g. \"input\" or \"data\"\nmade me want to try interning for vars. Just like all things interning,\nthis is slightly experimental and clearly marked as such. Worth highlighting\nhere is that the majority of vars allocated in at least Regal is however\nthose generated in eval.go.. and their names don't lend themselves well\nto interning beforehand. Perhaps we can find a way to change that later,\nas those account for a million+ allocations in `regal lint bundle`. Oh well.\n\nAlso some general improvements in the parser code, reducing allocations often\nsimply by moving things around in order to not evaluate (potentially allocating)\ncode before it's needed.\n\nSigned-off-by: Anders Eknert <anders@eknert.com>","github_username":"anderseknert","author_date":"2025-11-10T09:18:32Z"},"2b057270e91a0492802da46ae18263470c8c0e2d":{"message":"Updating e2e

http.Transport by http.send (#7927)\n\n* Ensure HTTP transport is setup when SNI is used\n\nAn operation specific http.Transport is not always setup in http.send.\nIn these cases, the ServerName populated in the TLS configuration is not\nused by the client. Existing tests did not exercise this path because\nthey would always configure additional TLS options that resulted in an\noperation specific transport.\n\nThis change moves the Host header and tls_server_name processing closer\nto the rest of the TLS logic and sets isTLS to true to ensure a custom\ntransport is configured.\n\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Sykes <matthew.sykes@fmr.com>\n\n* Simplify http.Transport construction for http.send\n\nWhen unix domain sockets are used, the URL scheme is forced to \"http\".\nThis change effectively disables TLS and removes the need to wire a\ntls.Config instance.\n\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Sykes <matthew.sykes@fmr.com>\n\n* Avoid unnecessary use of customized transport\n\nUnless specific options are used with http.send that necessitate a\ncustom http.Transport configuration, the default transport should be\nused to perform the operation.\n\nUnder load, policies that use http.send were encountering errors and\nhigh throughput variability. While troubleshooting, we noted a high\nnumber of sockets in the TIME_WAIT state. This indicated that client\nconnections were not getting reused during policy evaluation. We\nattempted to address this by increasing MaxIdleConns and\nMaxIdleConnsPerHost on the default transport. Unfortunately, this did\nnot help.\n\nWhen we looked through the code, we discovered that nearly every path\nthrough http.send creates a new transport. When transports aren't\nreused, connection pooling is effectively disabled. These new transports\nalso disable keep-alive. Either one of these effectively forces a new\nclient connections and associated TLS handshake for each request.\n\nWe found one existing path through the code that constructs an\nhttp.Client without a transport: explicitly setting tls_use_system_certs\nto false. When we made this change to our policy, the default transport\nwas used, we no longer encountered errors, and the throughput was higher\nand more stable.\n\nThis change removes the block that explicitly set tlsUseSystemCerts to\ntrue when tls_use_system_certs was unset and no other CA cert options\nwere used. This results in the use of the default transport when TLS\noptions are not set and, by default, the default transport will use the\nsystem certificate pool.\n\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Sykes <matthew.sykes@fmr.com>\n\n---------\n\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Sykes <matthew.sykes@fmr.com>","github_username":"sykesm","author_date":"2025-11-05T15:55:19Z"},"7c1713dcf2d07a340f28147ebff03f4f2d4d30ad":{"message":"CHANGELOG: integrate v1.10.1\n\nSigned-off-by: Stephan Renatus <stephan.renatus@gmail.com>","github_username":"srenatus","author_date":"2025-11-05T09:29:23Z"},"3f2e3658cc2090c1e833f1a9f922a0a2dabe2b74":{"message":"workflows/pull-request: fix indentation of 'if:' for setup-go\n\nSigned-off-by: Stephan Renatus <stephan.renatus@gmail.com>","github_username":"srenatus","author_date":"2025-11-05T08:44:25Z"},"55468b1022c2a44a0d856d0ba5a7ae77f50e8460":{"message":"topdown: fix split(..., \"\")\n\nFixes https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/8018\n\ngoos: darwin\ngoarch: arm64\npkg: github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/v1/topdown\ncpu: Apple M4 Max\n                                        │ main.bench  │               pr.bench               │\n                                        │   sec/op    │   sec/op     vs base                 │\nSplit-16                                  238.7n ± 1%   254.2n ± 1%  +6.47% (p=0.000 n=10)\n\n                                        │  main.bench  │              pr.bench               │\n                                        │     B/op     │    B/op     vs base                 │\nSplit-16                                  384.0 ± 0%     384.0 ± 0%       ~ (p=1.000 n=10) ¹\n¹ all samples are equal\n\n                                        │  main.bench  │              pr.bench               │\n                                        │  allocs/op   │ allocs/op   vs base                 │\nSplit-16                                  14.00 ± 0%     14.00 ± 0%       ~ (p=1.000 n=10) ¹\n¹ all samples are equal\n\nSigned-off-by: Stephan Renatus <stephan.renatus@gmail.com>","github_username":"srenatus","author_date":"2025-11-05T08:14:44Z"},"bdf2ee1044b19c1aa78fc7642e6d2441d380529c":{"message":"docs: Update the archive to have an edge link\n\nThis is in the admonition at the top but is now included in the archive\npage too.\n\nSigned-off-by: Charlie Egan <charlie_egan@apple.com>","github_username":"charlieegan3","author_date":"2025-11-03T14:26:03Z"},"2dd86a576f0c69992c60d6c5c4ad8db5590e15de":{"message":"docs: add example for Compile API's table mapping\n\nSigned-off-by: Stephan Renatus <stephan.renatus@gmail.com>","github_username":"srenatus","author_date":"2025-11-04T13:41:42Z"},"30d3346fb415415a9a3bade1cfbfa6394ea79037":{"message":"New custom SemVer implementation (#8010)\n\nThis was something I originally intended to use in another project,\nbut since this turned out to be a better implementation (subject of\ncourse to review!) in terms of both performance and simplicity, I\nfigured we might as well use it here too.
