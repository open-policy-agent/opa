# OPA Community Badges

Hello OPA Community Members! We thank you for taking the time to be a part of the community and for all of the work you’ve put in. As thanks, the OPA community now offers badges to recognize your contributions to the community.

As of right now, these badges are simple tokens of appreciation that we will proudly display in the OPA GitHub repository. As the program develops, we will provide digital badges and certificates for members to display on their Linkedin and Twitter accounts.

## Contributor Badge

We appreciate contributions to the OPA project, no matter how big or small. So if you’ve contributed a dozen lines of code or corrected a typo in the docs, let us know!

Our OPA Community Champions badges are for active members that want to create a measurable impact in the community. Apply for this badge if you believe in the OPA mission to unify policy authorization and wish to help the OPA community grow and expand.

Actively help and support the OPA community. Some places we will look for contributions are:

- Slack

- Meetups

Being a champion in the OPA community can take many shapes and forms; as such, we do not want to limit this award to a static number of posts or comments. Instead, we are looking for members who take an active role in helping to build the community, or we look for members that want to have a more active role.
