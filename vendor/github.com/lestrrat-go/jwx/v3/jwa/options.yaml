      NewSignatureKeyEncryptionAlgorithmOption represents an option that can be passed to both
      NewSignatureAlgorithm and NewKeyEncryptionAlgorithm

      - newSignatureAlgorithmOption

options:
  - ident: IsSymmetric
    interface: NewSignatureKeyEncryptionAlgorithmOption
    argument_type: bool
    comment: |
      IsSymmetric specifies that the algorithm is symmetric
  - ident: Deprecated
    interface: NewAlgorithmOption
    argument_type: bool
    comment: |
      WithDeprecated specifies that the algorithm is deprecated. In order to
      un-deprecate an algorithm, you will have to create a new algorithm
      with the same values but with the Deprecated option set to false, and
      then call RegisterXXXXAlgorithm with the new algorithm.
