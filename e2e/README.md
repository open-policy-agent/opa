# github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/e2e

This Go module is for end-to-end tests that come with dependencies we don't otherwise need for OPA, to avoid bloat in OPA's Go module's deps.

> [!warning]
> This module should never be imported from any of the other `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/*` packages!
