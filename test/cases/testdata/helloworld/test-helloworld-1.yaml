# If you are adding new built-in functions to Rego, you must include test cases in this format.
#
# Each test file contains a set of test 'cases'. Each test case includes a globally unique
# name that identifies the test case ('note'), a policy 'query' to execute, and a set of
# expectations (e.g., 'want_result'). Test cases can also assert on error conditions (e.g.,
# built-in function errors like divide-by-zero).
#
#  * Test cases may include zero or more Rego modules that support the test case.
#  * Test cases may set the value of the base documents loaded under 'data' and 'input'.
#
# The result set is unordered. Each element in the result set specifies variable assignments to
# expect from the query. The example below finds a single assignment of the number '7' to the
# variable 'x'.
#
# If you adding tests for a built-in function, prefix the note with the built-in function name.
# Use snake_case_for_the_note.
#
# Many of the test cases include a large blob of generic JSON data. This is an artifact
# of the source code where those cases were exported from. Do not copy the blob into new
# test cases.
#
# The OPA test suite (which is implemented using Go's standard testing framework) discovers tests
# added under ./topdown/testdata/cases. For example, to run only the tests in this file:
#
#   go test ./topdown -v -run 'TestRego/helloworld'
#
cases:
- data:
    foo: bar
  input:
    baz: bar
  modules:
  - |
    package test

    p = 7 {
      data.foo == q
    }

    q = input.baz
  note: helloworld/test_case
  query: data.test.p = x
  want_result:
  - x: 7
- note: helloworld/another_test_for_builtin_error
  query: 1 / 0
  strict_error: true
  want_error: 'div: divide by zero'
  want_error_code: eval_builtin_error
