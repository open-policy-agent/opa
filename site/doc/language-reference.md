# Language Reference

This document is the authoritative specification of the Rego policy language
(V1). All policies in OPA are written in Rego.

## Built-in Functions

The built-in functions for the language provide basic operations to manipulate
scalar values (e.g. numbers and strings), and aggregate functions that summarize
complex types.

The input `string` is a JSON Web Token encoded with JWS Compact Serialization. JWE and JWS JSON Serialization are not supported. If nested signing was used, the ``header``, ``payload`` and ``signature`` will represent the most deeply nested token.

> Multiple calls to the `time.now_ns` built-in function within a single policy
evaluation query will always the same value.

## <a name="reserved"></a> Reserved Names

The following words are reserved and cannot be used as variable names, rule
names, or dot-access style reference arguments:

```
as
default
else
false
import
package
not
null
true
with
```

## <a name="grammar"></a> Grammar

Rego’s syntax is defined by the following grammar:

```
module         = package { import } policy
package        = "package" ref
import         = "import" package [ "as" var ]
policy         = { rule }
rule           = [ "default" ] rule-head { rule-body }
rule-head      = var [ "[" term "]" ] [ = term ]
rule-body      = [ else [ = term ] ] "{" query "}"
query          = literal { ";" | [\r\n] literal }
literal        = ( expr | "not" expr ) { with-modifier }
with-modifier  = "with" term "as" term
expr           = term | expr-built-in | expr-infix
expr-built-in  = var [ "." var ] "(" [ term { , term } ] ")"
expr-infix     = [ term "=" ] term infix-operator term
term           = ref | var | scalar | array | object | set | array-compr
array-compr    = "[" term "|" rule-body "]"
infix-operator = bool-operator | arith-operator | bin-operator
bool-operator  = "=" | "!=" | "<" | ">" | ">=" | "<="
arith-operator = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
bin-operator   = "&" | "|"
ref            = var { ref-arg }
ref-arg        = ref-arg-dot | ref-arg-brack
ref-arg-brack  = "[" ( scalar | var | "_" ) "]"
ref-arg-dot    = "." var
var            = ( ALPHA | "_" ) { ALPHA | DIGIT | "_" }
scalar         = STRING | NUMBER | TRUE | FALSE | NULL
array          = "[" term { "," term } "]"
object         = "{" object-item { "," object-item } "}"
object-item    = ( scalar | ref | var ) ":" term
set            = empty-set | non-empty-set
non-empty-set  = "{" term { "," term } "}"
empty-set      = "set(" ")"
```

The grammar defined above makes use of the following syntax. See [the Wikipedia page on EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_Form) for more details:

```
[]     optional (zero or one instances)
{}     repetition (zero or more instances)
|      alteration (one of the instances)
()     grouping (order of expansion)
STRING JSON string
NUMBER JSON number
TRUE   JSON true
FALSE  JSON false
NULL   JSON null
ALPHA  ASCII characters A-Z and a-z
DIGIT  ASCII characters 0-9
```
