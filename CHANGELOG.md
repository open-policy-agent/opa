# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 0.4.3

### Fixes

- Fix parsing of inline comments ([#258](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/258))
- Fix unset of input/data in REPL ([#259](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/259))
- Handle non-string/var values in rule tree lookup ([#257](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/257))

## 0.4.2

### Rego

This release changes the Rego syntax. The two main changes are:

- Expressions are now separated by semicolons (instead of commas). When writing rules, the semicolons are optional.
- Rules are no longer written in the form: `head :- body`. Instead they are written as `head { body }`.

Also:

- Set, array, and object literals now support trailing commas.
- To declare a set literal with one element, you must include a trailing comma, e.g., `{ foo, }`.
- Arithmetic and set operations can now be performed with infix notation, e.g., `x = 2 + 1`.
- Sets can be referred to like objects and arrays now ([#243](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/243)). E.g., `p[_].foo = 1 # check if element in has attr foo equal to 1`.

### Evaluation

This release changes the evaluation behaviour for packages. Previously, if a package contained no rules OR all of the rules were undefined when evaluated, a query against the package path would return undefined. As of v0.4.2 the query will return an empty object.

### REST API

This release changes the Data API to return an HTTP 200 response if the document is undefined. The message body will contain an object without the `result` property.

### Fixes

- Allow sets to be treated like objects/arrays

### Miscellaneous

- Added high level API for Go users. See `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego` package.
- Improved expression String() function to handle infix operators better.
- Added support for set intersection and union built-ins. See language docs.

## 0.4.1

### Rego

For more details on these changes see sections in [How Do I Write Policies](http://www.openpolicyagent.org/documentation/how-do-i-write-policies/).

- Added new **default** keyword. The default keyword can be used to provide a default value for rules with complete definitions.
- Added new **with** keyword. The with keyword can be used to programmatically set the value of the input document inside policies.

### Fixes

- Fix input document definition in REPL ([#231](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/231))
- Fix reference evaluation bug ([#238](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/238))

### Miscellaneous

- Add basic REST API authorization benchmark

## 0.4.0

### REST API changes

This release contains a few non-backwards compatible changes to the REST API:

- The `request` document has been renamed to `input`. If you were calling the
  GET /data[/path]?request=value you should update to use [POST
  requests](http://www.openpolicyagent.org/documentation/references/rest#get-a-document-with-input)
  (see below).

- The API responses have been updated to return results embedded inside a
  wrapper object: `{"result": value}`. This will allow OPA to return unambiguous
  metadata in future (e.g., pagination, analysis, etc.) If you were previously
  consuming Data API GET responses, you should update your code to access the
  value under the `"result"` key of the response object.

- The API models have been updated to use snake_case
  ([#222](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/222)). This would only
  affect you if you were previously consuming error responses or policy ASTs.

The Data API has been updated to support the [POST
requests](http://www.openpolicyagent.org/documentation/references/rest#get-a-document-with-input).
This is the recommended way of supplying query inputs.

### Built-in Function changes

The built-in framework has been extended to support simplified built-in
implementations:

- Refactor topdown built-in functions
  ([#205](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/205))

### Fixes

- Add cURL note to REST API docs ([#211](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/211))
- Fix empty request parameter parsing ([#212](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/212))
- Fix handling of missing input document ([#227](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/227))
- Improve floating point literal support ([#215](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/215))
- Improve module parsing errors ([#213](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/213))
- Fix ast.Number hash and equality
- Fix parsing of escaped strings

### Miscellaneous

- Improve evaluation error messages

## 0.3.1

### Fixes

- Fixed unsafe vars with built-in operator names bug ([#206](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/206))
- Fixed body to rule conversion bug ([#202](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/202))
- Improved request parameter handling ([#201](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/201))

### Miscellaneous

- Improved release infrastructure

## 0.3.0

The last major/minor release of 2016! Woohoo! This release contains a few
non-backwards compatible changes to the APIs.

### Storage API changes

These changes simplify and clean up the storage.Store interface. This should
make it easier to implement custom stores in the future.

- Update storage to support context.Context ([#155](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/155))
- Update underlying number representation ([#154](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/154))
- Updates to use new storage.Path type ([#159](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/159))

### The request Document

These changes update the language to align query arguments with state stored in
OPA. With these changes, OPA can readily analyze policies and determine
references that refer to state stored in OPA versus query arguments versus local
variables.

These changes also update how query arguments are provided via the REST API.

- Updates to how query arguments are handled [#197](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/197)

### topdown API changes

- topdown.Context has been renamed to topdown.Topdown to avoid confusion with Golang's context.

### Fixes

- Add help topics to REPL ([#172](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/172))
- Fix error handling bug in Query API ([#183](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/183))
- Fix handling of prefixed paths with -w flag ([#193](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/193))
- Improve exit handling in REPL ([#175](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/175))
- Update parser support for <var> = <term> rules ([#192](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/192))

### Miscellaneous

- Add Visual Studio and Atom plugins
- Add lazy loading of modules during compilation
- Fix bug in serialization of empty objects/arrays
