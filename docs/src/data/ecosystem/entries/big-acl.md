Big ACL is a policy administration platform that lets business and security teams author authorization rules in plain language, then automatically translates them into Rego policies for OPA. It supports the full policy lifecycle — collaborative authoring, automated testing, conflict detection, versioned snapshots with side-by-side diffs, and multi-environment promotion with rollback.

Big ACL natively integrates with OPA through bundle distribution (tar.gz with ETag-based polling), instance status tracking, and decision log collection. It supports RBAC, ABAC, and ReBAC patterns across multiple tenants.
