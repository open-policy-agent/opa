Magda is a federated, Kubernetes-based, open-source data catalog system.
Working as Magda's central authorisation policy engine, OPA helps not only the API endpoint authorisation.
Magda also uses its partial evaluation feature to translate datasets authorisation decisions to other database-specific DSLs (e.g. SQL or Elasticsearch DSL) and use them for dataset authorisation enforcement in different databases.
