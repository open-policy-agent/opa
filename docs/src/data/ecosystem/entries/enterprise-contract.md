    note: |
      The [Enterprise Contract](https://enterprisecontract.dev/) uses the OPA go
      library to process rego policies when validating the signatures and
      attestations of container images and other software artifacts.
---
Securely verify supply chain artifacts, and enforce policies about how they were built and tested,
in a manageable, scalable, and declarative way.
