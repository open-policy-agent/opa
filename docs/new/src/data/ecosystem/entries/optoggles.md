OPToggles uses OPA and OPAL to sync open-policy to your frontend with the help of feature flag solutions.
OPToggles creates user-targeted feature flags based on the policy rules you defined in OPA and keeps the users updated in real-time with OPAL's real-time policy and policy-data change detection.
OPToggles already supports launchdarkly.com and a generic REST API.
