# Pre-Commit Hooks

[Pre-Commit](https://pre-commit.com) is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.
This allows running Regal automatically whenever (and as the name implied, before )a Rego file is about to be committed.

To use Regal with pre-commit, add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/regal
  rev: v0.7.0 # Use the ref you want to point at
  hooks:
    - id: regal-lint
  # -   id: ...
```

## Hooks Available
