# function-arg-return

**Summary**: Return value assigned in function argument

**Category**: Style

**Avoid**
```rego
package policy

has_email(user) if {
    indexof(user.email, "@", i)
    i != -1
}
```

**Prefer**

```rego
package policy

has_email(user) if {
    i := indexof(user.email, "@")
    i != -1
}
```

## Rationale

Older Rego policies sometimes contain an unusual way to declare where the return value of a function call should be
stored â€” the last argument of the function. True to its Datalog roots, return values may be stored either using
assignment (i.e. `:=`) or by appending a variable name to the argument list of a function. While both forms are valid,
using assignment `:=` consistently is preferred.

## Exceptions

The `walk` built-in function is a special one, as it's the only one producing a *relation*. Therefore, it is okay to
treat it as one even in style, and:

```rego
walk(object, [path, value])
```

is arguably more idiomatic than:

```rego
[path, value] := walk(object)
```

## Configuration Options

This linter rule provides the following configuration options:

```yaml
rules:
  style:
    function-arg-return:
      # one of "error", "warning", "ignore"
      level: error
      # list of function names to ignore
      # * by default, walk is excepted from this rule
      # * note that `print` is always ignored as it does not return a value
      except-functions:
      - walk
```
