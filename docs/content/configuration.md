title: Configuration
kind: operations
weight: 10
---

This page defines the format of OPA configuration files. Fields marked as
required must be specified if the parent is defined. For example, when the
configuration contains a `status` key, the `status.service` field must be
defined.

The configuration file path is specified with the `-c` or `--config-file`
command line argument:

```bash
opa run -s -c config.yaml
```

The file can be either JSON or YAML format.


#### Example

```yaml
services:
  acmecorp:
    url: https://example.com/control-plane-api/v1
    response_header_timeout_seconds: 5
    credentials:
      bearer:
        token: "bGFza2RqZmxha3NkamZsa2Fqc2Rsa2ZqYWtsc2RqZmtramRmYWxkc2tm"

labels:
  app: myapp
  region: west
  environment: production

bundles:
  authz:
    service: acmecorp
    resource: bundles/http/example/authz.tar.gz
    persist: true
    polling:
      min_delay_seconds: 60
      max_delay_seconds: 120
    signing:
      keyid: global_key
      scope: write

decision_logs:
  service: acmecorp
  reporting:
    min_delay_seconds: 300
    max_delay_seconds: 600

status:
  service: acmecorp

default_decision: /http/example/authz/allow

persistence_directory: /var/opa

keys:
  global_key:
    algorithm: RS256
    key: <PEM_encoded_public_key>
    scope: read

caching:
  inter_query_builtin_cache:
    max_size_bytes: 10000000

distributed_tracing:
  type: grpc
  address: localhost:4317
  service_name: opa
  sample_percentage: 50
  encryption: "off"
```

#### Environment Variable Substitution
> Only supported with the OPA runtime (`opa run`).

Environment variables referenced with the `${...}` notation within the configuration
will be replaced with the value of the environment variable.

Example using `BASE_URL` and `BEARER_TOKEN` environment variables:
```yaml
services:
  acmecorp:
    url: ${BASE_URL}
    credentials:
      bearer:
        token: "${BEARER_TOKEN}"

discovery:
  resource: /configuration/example/discovery
  decision: example
```
The environment variables `BASE_URL` and `BEARER_TOKEN` will be substituted in when the config
file is loaded by the OPA runtime.

> If the variable is undefined then an empty string (`""`) is substituted. It will __not__
raise an error.

#### CLI Runtime Overrides
> Only supported with the OPA runtime (`opa run`).

Using `opa run` there are CLI options to explicitly set config values. These will override
any values set in the config file.

There are two options to use: `--set` and `--set-file`

Both options take in a key=value format where the key is a selector for the yaml
config structure, for example: `decision_logs.reporting.min_delay_seconds=300` is equivalent
to JSON `{"decision_logs": {"reporting": {"min_delay_seconds": 300}}}`. Multiple values can be
specified with comma separators (`key1=value,key2=value2,..`). Or with additional `--set`
parameters.

Example using several different options:
```
opa run \
  --set "default_decision=/http/example/authz/allow" \
  --set "services.acmecorp.url=https://test-env/control-plane-api/v1" \
  --set "services.acmecorp.credentials.bearer.token=\${TOKEN}"
  --set "labels.app=myapp,labels.region=west"
```
This is equivalent to a YAML config file that looks like:

```yaml
services:
  acmecorp:
    url: https://test-env/control-plane-api/v1
    credentials:
      bearer:
        token: ${TOKEN}

labels:
  app: myapp
  region: west

default_decision: /http/example/authz/allow
```

The `--set-file` option is expecting a file path for the value. This allows keeping secrets in
files and loading them into the config at run time. For Example:

With a file `/var/run/secrets/bearer_token.txt` that has contents:
```
bGFza2RqZmxha3NkamZsa2Fqc2Rsa2ZqYWtsc2RqZmtramRmYWxkc2tm
```

Then using the `--set-file` flag for OPA

```bash
opa run --set-file "services.acmecorp.credentials.bearer.token=/var/run/secrets/bearer_token.txt"
```

It will read the contents of the file and set the config value with the token.

##### Override Limitations
###### Lists
If using arrays/lists in the configuration the `--set` and `--set-file` overrides will not be able to
patch sub-objects of the list. They will overwrite the entire index with the new object.

For example, a `config.yaml` file with contents:
```yaml
services:
  - name: acmecorp
    url: https://test-env/control-plane-api/v1
    credentials:
      bearer:
        token: ""
```
Used with overrides:
```
opa run \
  --config-file config.yaml
  --set-file "services[0].credentials.bearer.token=/var/run/secrets/bearer_token.txt"
```

Will result in configuration like:
```yaml
services:
  - credentials:
      bearer:
        token: bGFza2RqZmxha3NkamZsa2Fqc2Rsa2ZqYWtsc2RqZmtramRmYWxkc2tm
```
Because the entire `0` index was overwritten.

It is highly recommended to use objects/maps instead of lists for configuration for this reason.

###### Empty objects
If you need to set an empty object with the CLI overrides, for example with plugin configuration like:

```yaml
decision_logs:
  plugin: my_plugin

plugins:
  my_plugin:
    # empty
```

You can do this by setting the value with `null`. For example:
```
opa run --set "decision_logs.plugin=my_plugin" --set "plugins.my_plugin=null"
```

###### Keys with Special Characters

If you have a key which contains a special character (`=`, `[`, `,`, `.`), like `opa.example.com`, and want to use
the `--set` or `--set-file` options you will need to escape the character with a backslash (`\`).

For example a config section like:

```yaml
services:
  opa.example.com:
    url: https://opa.example.com
```

Could be specified with something like:

`--set services.opa\.example\.com.url=https://opa.example.com`


Note that when using it in a shell you may need to put it in quotes or escape the `\`
character too. For example:


`--set services."opa\.example\.com".url=https://opa.example.com`

_or_

`--set services.opa\\.example\\.com.url=https://opa.example.com`

Where the end result passed into OPA still has the `\.` preserved.

#### Services

Services represent endpoints that implement one or more control plane APIs
such as the Bundle or Status APIs. OPA configuration files may contain
multiple services.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].name` | `string` | Yes | Unique name for the service. Referred to by plugins. |
| `services[_].url` | `string` | Yes | Base URL to contact the service with. |
| `services[_].response_header_timeout_seconds` | `int64` | No (default: 10) | Amount of time to wait for a server's response headers after fully writing the request. This time does not include the time to read the response body. |
| `services[_].headers` | `object` | No | HTTP headers to include in requests to the service. |
| `services[_].tls.ca_cert` | `string` | No | The path to the root CA certificate.  If not provided, this defaults to TLS using the host's root CA set. |
| `services[_].tls.system_ca_required` | `bool` | No (default: `false`) | Require system certificate appended with root CA certificate. |
| `services[_].allow_insecure_tls` | `bool` | No | Allow insecure TLS. |

Each service may optionally specify a credential mechanism by which OPA will authenticate
itself to the service.

#### Bearer Token

OPA will authenticate using the specified bearer token and schema; to enable bearer token
authentication, either the token or the path to the token must be specified. If the latter is provided, on each request OPA will re-read the token from the file and use that token for authentication.

The schema is optional and will default to `Bearer`
if unspecified.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.bearer.token` | `string` | Yes | Enables token-based authentication and supplies the bearer token to authenticate with. |
| `services[_].credentials.bearer.token_path` | `string` | Yes | Enables token-based authentication and supplies the path to the bearer token to authenticate with. |
| `services[_].credentials.bearer.scheme` | `string` | No | Bearer token scheme to specify. |

#### Client TLS Certificate

OPA will present the specified TLS certificate to authenticate. The paths to the client certificate
and the private key are required; the passphrase for the private key is only required if the
private key is encrypted.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.client_tls.cert` | `string` | Yes | The path to the client certificate to authenticate with. |
| `services[_].credentials.client_tls.private_key` | `string` | Yes | The path to the private key of the client certificate. |
| `services[_].credentials.client_tls.private_key_passphrase` | `string` | No | The passphrase to use for the private key. |

#### OAuth2 Client Credentials

OPA will authenticate using a bearer token obtained through the OAuth2 [client credentials](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) flow.
Following successful authentication at the token endpoint the returned token will be cached for subsequent requests for the duration of its lifetime. Note that as per the [OAuth2 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1), only the HTTPS scheme is supported for the token endpoint URL.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.token_url` | `string` | Yes | URL pointing to the token endpoint at the OAuth2 authorization server. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.client_id` | `string` | Yes | The client ID to use for authentication. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.client_secret` | `string` | Yes | The client secret to use for authentication. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.scopes` | `[]string` | No | Optional list of scopes to request for the token. |

#### OAuth2 Client Credentials JWT authentication

OPA will authenticate using a bearer token obtained through the OAuth2 [client credentials](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) flow.
Rather than providing a client secret along with the request for an access token, the client [asserts](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7521#section-4.2) its identity in the form of a signed JWT.
Following successful authentication at the token endpoint the returned token will be cached for subsequent requests for the duration of its lifetime. Note that as per the [OAuth2 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1), only the HTTPS scheme is supported for the token endpoint URL.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.token_url` | `string` | Yes | URL pointing to the token endpoint at the OAuth2 authorization server. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.grant_type` | `string` | No | Defaults to `client_credentials`. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.client_id` | `string` | No | The client ID to use for authentication. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.signing_key` | `string` | Yes | Reference to private key used for signing the JWT. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.thumbprint` | `string` | No | Certificate thumbprint to use for x5t header generation. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.additional_claims` | `map` | No | Map of claims to include in the JWT (see notes below) |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.include_jti_claim` | `bool` | No | Include a uniquely generated `jti` claim in any issued JWT |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.scopes` | `[]string` | No | Optional list of scopes to request for the token. |

Two claims will always be included in the issued JWT: `iat` and `exp`. Any other claims will be populated from the `additional_claims` map.

##### Example

Using the client credentials grant type with JWT client authentication replacing client secret as the credential used at the token endpoint.

```yaml
services:
  remote:
    url: ${BUNDLE_SERVICE_URL}
    credentials:
      oauth2:
        token_url: ${TOKEN_URL}
        grant_type: client_credentials
        client_id: opa-client
        signing_key: jwt_signing_key # references the key in `keys` below
        include_jti_claim: true
        scopes:
        - read
        - write
        additional_claims:
          sub: opa-client
          iss: opa-${POD_NAME}

bundles:
  authz:
    service: remote
    resource: bundles/http/example/authz.tar.gz

keys:
  jwt_signing_key:
    algorithm: ES512
    private_key: ${BUNDLE_SERVICE_SIGNING_KEY}
```

#### OAuth2 JWT Bearer Grant Type

OPA will authenticate using a bearer token obtained through the OAuth2 [JWT authorization grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523#section-2.1) flow.
Rather than providing a client secret along with the request for an access token, the client [asserts](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7521#section-4.1) its identity in the form of a signed JWT.
Following successful authentication at the token endpoint the returned token will be cached for subsequent requests for the duration of its lifetime. Note that as per the [OAuth2 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1), only the HTTPS scheme is supported for the token endpoint URL.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.token_url` | `string` | Yes | URL pointing to the token endpoint at the OAuth2 authorization server. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.grant_type` | `string` | No | Must be set to `jwt_bearer` for JWT bearer grant type. Defaults to `client_credentials`. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.signing_key` | `string` | Yes | Reference to private key used for signing the JWT. |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.additional_claims` | `map` | No | Map of claims to include in the JWT (see notes below) |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.include_jti_claim` | `bool` | No | Include a uniquely generated `jti` claim in any issued JWT |
| `services[_].credentials.oauth2.scopes` | `[]string` | No | Optional list of scopes to request for the token. |

Two claims will always be included in the issued JWT: `iat` and `exp`. Any other claims will be populated from the `additional_claims` map.

##### Example

Using a [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) bucket as a bundle service backend from outside the
cloud account (for access from inside the account, see the [GCP Metadata Token](#gcp-metadata-token) section).

```yaml
services:
  gcp:
    url: https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/${BUCKET_NAME}/o
    credentials:
      oauth2:
        token_url: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
        grant_type: jwt_bearer
        signing_key: jwt_signing_key # references the key in `keys` below
        scopes:
        - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only
        additional_claims:
          aud: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
          iss: opa-client@my-account.iam.gserviceaccount.com

bundles:
  authz:
    service: gcp
    resource: 'bundles/http/example/authz.tar.gz?alt=media'

keys:
  jwt_signing_key:
    algorithm: RS256
    private_key: ${BUNDLE_SERVICE_SIGNING_KEY}
```

{{< danger >}}
OPA masks services authentication secrets which make use of the `credentials` field, in order to prevent the exposure of sensitive tokens.
It is important to note that the [/v1/config API](../rest-api/#config-api) allows clients to read the runtime configuration of OPA. As such, any credentials used by
custom configurations not utilizing the credentials field will be exposed to the caller.
Consider requiring authentication in order to prevent unauthorized read access to OPA's runtime configuration.
{{< /danger >}}

#### AWS Signature

OPA will authenticate with an [AWS4 HMAC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html) signature. Several methods of obtaining the
necessary credentials are available; exactly one must be specified to use the AWS signature
authentication method.

The AWS service for which to sign the request can be specified in the `service` field. If omitted, the default is `s3`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.s3_signing.service` | `string` | No | The AWS service to sign requests with, eg `execute-api` or `s3`. Default: `s3` |

##### Using Static Environment Credentials
If specifying `environment_credentials`, OPA will expect to find environment variables
for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_REGION`, in accordance with the
convention used by the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html).

Please note that if you are using temporary IAM credentials (e.g. assumed IAM role credentials) you have to provide additional `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` or `AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN` environment variable.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.s3_signing.environment_credentials` | `{}` | Yes | Enables AWS signing using environment variables to source the configuration and credentials |


##### Using Named Profile Credentials
If specifying `profile_credentials`, OPA will expect to find the `access key id`, `secret access key` and
`session token` from the [named profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html)
stored in the [credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/file-format.html) file on disk. On each
request OPA will re-read the credentials from the file and use them for authentication.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.s3_signing.profile_credentials.path` | `string` | No | The path to the shared credentials file. If empty, OPA will look for the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` env variable. If the variable is not set, the path defaults to the current user's home directory. `~/.aws/credentials` (Linux & Mac) or `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials` (Windows) |
| `services[_].credentials.s3_signing.profile_credentials.profile` | `string` | No | AWS Profile to extract credentials from the credentials file. If empty, OPA will look for the `AWS_PROFILE` env variable. If the variable is not set, the `default` profile will be used |
| `services[_].credentials.s3_signing.metadata_credentials.aws_region` | `string` | No | The AWS region to use for the AWS signing service credential method. If unset, the `AWS_REGION` environment variable must be set |

##### Using EC2 Metadata Credentials
If specifying `metadata_credentials`, OPA will use the AWS metadata services for [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html)
or [ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/userguide/task-iam-roles.html)
to obtain the necessary credentials when running within a supported virtual machine/container.

To use the EC2 metadata service, the IAM role to use and the AWS region for the resource must both
be specified as `iam_role` and `aws_region` respectively.

To use the ECS metadata service, specify only the AWS region for the resource as `aws_region`. ECS
containers have at most one associated IAM role.

**N.B.** Providing a value for `iam_role` will cause OPA to use the EC2 metadata service even
if running inside an ECS container. This may result in unexpected problems if, for example,
there is no route to the EC2 metadata service from inside the container or if the IAM role is only available within the container and not from the hosting EC2 instance.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.s3_signing.metadata_credentials.aws_region` | `string` | No | The AWS region to use for the AWS signing service credential method. If unset, the `AWS_REGION` environment variable must be set |
| `services[_].credentials.s3_signing.metadata_credentials.iam_role` | `string` | No | The IAM role to use for the AWS signing service credential method |

##### Using EKS IAM Roles for Service Account (Web Identity) Credentials
If specifying `web_identity_credentials`, OPA will expect to find environment variables for `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`, in accordance with the convention used by the [AWS EKS IAM Roles for Service Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-technical-overview.html#pod-configuration).

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.s3_signing.web_identity_credentials.aws_region` | `string` | Yes | The AWS region to use for the sts regional endpoint. Uses the global endpoint by default |
| `services[_].credentials.s3_signing.web_identity_credentials.session_name` | `string` | No | The session name used to identify the assumed role session. Default: `open-policy-agent` |

> Services can be defined as an array or object. When defined as an object, the
> object keys override the `services[_].name` fields.
> For example:
```yaml
services:
  s1:
    url: https://s1/example/
  s2:
    url: https://s2/
```
Is equivalent to
```yaml
services:
  - name: s1
    url: https://s1/example/
  - name: s2
    url: https://s2/
```

#### GCP Metadata Token

OPA will authenticate with a GCP [access token](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/service-identity#access_tokens) or [identity token](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/securing/service-identity) fetched from the [Compute Metadata Server](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata). When one or more `scopes` is provided an access token is fetched. When a non-empty `audience` is provided an identity token is fetched. An audience or `scopes` array is required.

When authenticating to native GCP services such as [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) an access token should be used with the appropriate set of scopes required by the target resource. When authenticating to a third party application such as an application hosted on Google Cloud Run an identity token should be used.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|`services[_].credentials.gcp_metadata.audience`|`string`|No|The audience to use when fetching identity tokens.|
|`services[_].credentials.gcp_metadata.endpoint`|`string`|No|The metadata endpoint to use.|
|`services[_].credentials.gcp_metadata.scopes`|`array`|No|The set of scopes to use when fetching access token.|
|`services[_].credentials.gcp_metadata.access_token_path`|`string`|No|The access token metadata path to use.|
|`services[_].credentials.gcp_metadata.id_token_path`|`string`|No|The identity token metadata path to use.|

##### Example

    persist: true
    polling:
      min_delay_seconds: 60
      max_delay_seconds: 120
```

#### Azure Managed Identities Token

OPA will authenticate with an [Azure managed identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) token. 
The [token request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token#get-a-token-using-http) 
can be configured via the plugin to customize the base URL, API version, and resource. Specific managed identity IDs can be optionally provided as well.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `services[_].credentials.azure_managed_identity.endpoint` | `string` | No | Request endpoint. (default: `http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token`, the Azure Instance Metadata Service endpoint (recommended))|
| `services[_].credentials.azure_managed_identity.api_version` | `string` | No | API version to use. (default: `2018-02-01`, the minimum version) |
| `services[_].credentials.azure_managed_identity.resource` | `string` | No | App ID URI of the target resource. (default: `https://storage.azure.com/`) |
| `services[_].credentials.azure_managed_identity.object_id` | `string` | No | Optional object ID of the managed identity you would like the token for. Required, if your VM has multiple user-assigned managed identites. |
| `services[_].credentials.azure_managed_identity.client_id` | `string` | No | Optional client ID of the managed identity you would like the token for. Required, if your VM has multiple user-assigned managed identites. |
| `services[_].credentials.azure_managed_identity.mi_res_id` | `string` | No | Optional Azure Resource ID of the managed identity you would like the token for. Required, if your VM has multiple user-assigned managed identites. |

##### Example
Use an [Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) as a bundle service backend.
Note that the `x-ms-version` header must be specified for the storage account service, and a minimum version of `2017-11-09` must be provided as per [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-azure-active-directory#call-storage-operations-with-oauth-tokens).

```yaml
services: 
  azure_storage_account: 
    url: ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL}
    headers:
      x-ms-version: 2017-11-09
    response_header_timeout_seconds: 5
    credentials: 
      azure_managed_identity: {}

bundles: 
  authz: 
    service: azure_storage_account
    resource: bundles/http/example/authz.tar.gz
    persist: true
    polling: 
      min_delay_seconds: 60
      max_delay_seconds: 120
```

#### Custom Plugin

If none of the existing credential options work for a service, OPA can authenticate using a custom plugin, enabling support for any authentication scheme.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|`services[_].credentials.plugin`|`string`|No|The name of the plugin to use for authentication|

##### Example

Using a custom plugin for service credentials:

```yaml

### Bundles

Bundles are defined with a key that is the `name` of the bundle. This `name` is used in the status API, decision logs,
server provenance, etc.

Each bundle can be configured to verify a bundle signature using the `keyid` and `scope` fields. The `keyid` is the name of
one of the keys listed under the [keys](#keys) entry.
