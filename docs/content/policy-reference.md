## Assignment and Equality

```live:assign_equality:query:read_only
# assign variable x to value of field foo.bar.baz in input
x := input.foo.bar.baz

# check if variable x has same value as variable y
x == y

# check if variable x is a set containing "foo" and "bar"
x == {"foo", "bar"}

# OR

{"foo", "bar"} == x
```

## Lookup

### Arrays

```live:lookup/arrays:query:read_only
# lookup value at index 0
val := arr[0]

 # check if value at index 0 is "foo"
"foo" == arr[0]

# find all indices i that have value "foo"
"foo" == arr[i]

# lookup last value
val := arr[count(arr)-1]

# with `import future.keywords.in`
some 0, val in arr   # lookup value at index 0
0, "foo" in arr      # check if value at index 0 is "foo"

### Objects

| Built-in | Description | Wasm Support |
| ------- |-------------|---------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">`value := object.get(object, key, default)`</span> | `value` is the value stored by the `object` at `key`. If no value is found, `default` is returned. | ✅ |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">`output := object.remove(object, keys)`</span> | `output` is a new object which is the result of removing the specified `keys` from `object`. `keys` must be either an array, object, or set of keys. | ✅ |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">`output := object.union(objectA, objectB)`</span> | `output` is a new object which is the result of an asymmetric recursive union of two objects where conflicts are resolved by choosing the key from the right-hand object (`objectB`). For example: `object.union({"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": {"d": 3}}, {"a": 7, "c": {"d": 4, "e": 5}})` will result in `{"a": 7, "b": 2, "c": {"d": 4, "e": 5}}` | ✅ |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">`output := object.union_n(array)`</span> | `output` is a new object which is the result of an asymmetric recursive union of all objects in `array`, merged from left to right, where conflicts are resolved by choosing the key from the right-hand object. For example: `object.union_n([{"a": 1}, {"b": 2}, {"a": 3}])` will result in `{"b": 2, "a": 3}` | ``SDK-dependent`` |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">`filtered := object.filter(object, keys)`</span> | `filtered` is a new object with the remaining data from `object` with only keys specified in `keys` which is an array, object, or set of keys. For example: `object.filter({"a": {"b": "x", "c": "y"}, "d": "z"}, ["a"])` will result in `{"a": {"b": "x", "c": "y"}}`). | ✅ |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">`filtered := json.filter(object, paths)`</span> | `filtered` is the remaining data from `object` with only keys specified in `paths` which is an array or set of JSON string paths. For example: `json.filter({"a": {"b": "x", "c": "y"}}, ["a/b"])` will result in `{"a": {"b": "x"}}`). Paths are not filtered in-order and are deduplicated before being evaluated. | ✅ |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">`output := json.remove(object, paths)`</span> | `output` is a new object which is the result of removing all keys specified in `paths` which is an array or set of JSON string paths. For example: `json.remove({"a": {"b": "x", "c": "y"}}, ["a/b"])` will result in `{"a": {"c": "y"}}`. Paths are not removed in-order and are deduplicated before being evaluated. | ✅ |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">`output := json.patch(object, patches)`</span> | `output` is a the object obtained after consecutively applying all [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) operations in the array `patches`. For example: `json.patch({"a": {"foo": 1}}, [{"op": "add", "path": "/a/bar", "value": 2}])` results in `{"a": {"foo": 1, "bar": 2}`.  The patches are applied atomically: if any of them fails, the result will be undefined. | ``SDK-dependent`` |

* When `keys` are provided as an object only the top level keys on the object will be used, values are ignored.
  For example: `object.remove({"a": {"b": {"c": 2}}, "x": 123}, {"a": 1}) == {"x": 123}` regardless of the value
  for key `a` in the keys object, the following `keys` object gives the same result
  `object.remove({"a": {"b": {"c": 2}}, "x": 123}, {"a": {"b": {"foo": "bar"}}}) == {"x": 123}`.


* The `json` string `paths` may reference into array values by using index numbers. For example with the object
  `{"a": ["x", "y", "z"]}` the path `a/1` references `y`. Nested structures are supported as well, for example:
  `{"a": ["x", {"y": {"y1": {"y2": ["foo", "bar"]}}}, "z"]}` the path `a/1/y1/y2/0` references `"foo"`.


* The `json` string `paths` support `~0`, or `~1` characters for `~` and `/` characters in key names.
  It does not support `-` for last index of an array. For example the path `/foo~1bar~0` will reference `baz`
  in `{ "foo/bar~": "baz" }`.


* The `json` string `paths` may be an array of string path segments rather than a `/` separated string. For example
  the path `a/b/c` can be passed in as `["a", "b", "c"]`.

### Token Signing

OPA provides two builtins that implement JSON Web Signature [RFC7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515) functionality.

``io.jwt.encode_sign_raw()`` takes three JSON Objects (strings) as parameters and returns their JWS Compact Serialization.
 This builtin should be used by those that want maximum control over the signing and serialization procedure. It is
 important to remember that StringOrURI values are compared as case-sensitive strings with no transformations or
 canonicalizations applied. Therefore, line breaks and whitespaces are significant.

``io.jwt.encode_sign()`` takes three Rego Objects as parameters and returns their JWS Compact Serialization. This builtin
 should be used by those that want to use rego objects for signing during policy evaluation.

> Note that with `io.jwt.encode_sign` the Rego objects are serialized to JSON with standard formatting applied
> whereas the `io.jwt.encode_sign_raw` built-in will **not** affect whitespace of the strings passed in.
> This will mean that the final encoded token may have different string values, but the decoded and parsed
> JSON will match.

The following algorithms are supported:

	ES256       "ES256" // ECDSA using P-256 and SHA-256
	ES384       "ES384" // ECDSA using P-384 and SHA-384
	ES512       "ES512" // ECDSA using P-521 and SHA-512
	HS256       "HS256" // HMAC using SHA-256
	HS384       "HS384" // HMAC using SHA-384
	HS512       "HS512" // HMAC using SHA-512
	PS256       "PS256" // RSASSA-PSS using SHA256 and MGF1-SHA256
	PS384       "PS384" // RSASSA-PSS using SHA384 and MGF1-SHA384
	PS512       "PS512" // RSASSA-PSS using SHA512 and MGF1-SHA512
	RS256       "RS256" // RSASSA-PKCS-v1.5 using SHA-256
	RS384       "RS384" // RSASSA-PKCS-v1.5 using SHA-384
	RS512       "RS512" // RSASSA-PKCS-v1.5 using SHA-512

##### Raw Token Signing

If you need to generate the signature for a serialized token you an use the
`io.jwt.encode_sign_raw` built-in function which accepts JSON serialized string
parameters.

```live:jwt/raw:query:merge_down
io.jwt.encode_sign_raw(
    `{"typ":"JWT","alg":"HS256"}`,
     `{"iss":"joe","exp":1300819380,"http://example.com/is_root":true}`,
    `{"kty":"oct","k":"AyM1SysPpbyDfgZld3umj1qzKObwVMkoqQ-EstJQLr_T-1qS0gZH75aKtMN3Yj0iPS4hcgUuTwjAzZr1Z9CAow"}`
)
```
```live:jwt/raw:output
```

Supports the following algorithms: HS256, HS384, HS512, RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512, PS256, PS384 and PS512. | ``SDK-dependent`` |

> Note that the `io.jwt.verify_XX` built-in methods verify **only** the signature. They **do not** provide any validation for the JWT

The input `string` is a JSON Web Token encoded with JWS Compact Serialization. JWE and JWS JSON Serialization are not supported. If nested signing was used, the ``header``, ``payload`` and ``signature`` will represent the most deeply nested token.

For ``io.jwt.decode_verify``, ``constraints`` is an object with the following members:

| Name | Meaning | Required |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| ``cert`` | A PEM encoded certificate, PEM encoded public key, or a JWK key (set) containing an RSA or ECDSA public key. | See below |
| ``secret`` | The secret key for HS256, HS384 and HS512 verification. | See below |
| ``alg`` | The JWA algorithm name to use. If it is absent then any algorithm that is compatible with the key is accepted. | Optional |
| ``iss`` | The issuer string. If it is present the only tokens with this issuer are accepted. If it is absent then any issuer is accepted. | Optional |
| ``time`` | The time in nanoseconds to verify the token at. If this is present then the ``exp`` and ``nbf`` claims are compared against this value. If it is absent then they are compared against the current time. | Optional |
| ``aud`` | The audience that the verifier identifies with.  If this is present then the ``aud`` claim is checked against it. **If it is absent then the ``aud`` claim must be absent too.** | Optional |

Exactly one of ``cert`` and ``secret`` must be present. If there are any
unrecognized constraints then the token is considered invalid.


#### Token Verification Examples

The examples below use the following token:

```live:jwt/verify:module
es256_token = "eyJ0eXAiOiAiSldUIiwgImFsZyI6ICJFUzI1NiJ9.eyJuYmYiOiAxNDQ0NDc4NDAwLCAiaXNzIjogInh4eCJ9.lArczfN-pIL8oUU-7PU83u-zfXougXBZj6drFeKFsPEoVhy9WAyiZlRshYqjTSXdaw8yw2L-ovt4zTUZb2PWMg"
```

##### Using JWKS
This example shows a two-step process to verify the token signature and then decode it for
further checks of the payload content. This approach gives more flexibility in verifying only
the claims that the policy needs to enforce.
```live:jwt/verify/jwks:module
jwks = `{
    "keys": [{
        "kty":"EC",
        "crv":"P-256",
        "x":"z8J91ghFy5o6f2xZ4g8LsLH7u2wEpT2ntj8loahnlsE",
        "y":"7bdeXLH61KrGWRdh7ilnbcGQACxykaPKfmBccTHIOUo"
    }]
}`
```

```live:jwt/verify/jwks/two_step:query:merge_down
io.jwt.verify_es256(es256_token, jwks)                  # Verify the token with the JWKS
[header, payload, _] := io.jwt.decode(es256_token)      # Decode the token
payload.iss == "xxx"                                    # Ensure the issuer (`iss`) claim is the expected value
```
```live:jwt/verify/jwks/two_step:output
```
The next example shows doing the token signature verification, decoding, and content checks
all in one call using `io.jwt.decode_verify`. Note that this gives less flexibility in validating
the payload content as **all** claims defined in the JWT spec are verified with the provided
constraints.
```live:jwt/verify/jwks/one_step:query:merge_down
[valid, header, payload] := io.jwt.decode_verify(es256_token, {
    "cert": jwks,
    "iss": "xxx",
})
```
```live:jwt/verify/jwks/one_step:output
```

##### Using PEM encoded X.509 Certificate
The following examples will demonstrate verifying tokens using an X.509 Certificate
defined as:
```live:jwt/verify/cert:module
cert = `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIBcDCCARagAwIBAgIJAMZmuGSIfvgzMAoGCCqGSM49BAMCMBMxETAPBgNVBAMM

-----END CERTIFICATE-----`
```
This example shows a two-step process to verify the token signature and then decode it for
further checks of the payload content. This approach gives more flexibility in verifying only
the claims that the policy needs to enforce.
```live:jwt/verify/cert/two_step:query:merge_down
io.jwt.verify_es256(es256_token, cert)                # Verify the token with the certificate
[header, payload, _] := io.jwt.decode(es256_token)    # Decode the token
payload.iss == "xxx"                                  # Ensure the issuer claim is the expected value
```
```live:jwt/verify/cert/two_step:output
```
The next example shows doing the same token signature verification, decoding, and content checks
but instead with a single call to `io.jwt.decode_verify`. Note that this gives less flexibility
in validating the payload content as **all** claims defined in the JWT spec are verified with the
provided constraints.
```live:jwt/verify/cert/one_step:query:merge_down
[valid, header, payload] := io.jwt.decode_verify(     # Decode and verify in one-step
    es256_token,
    {                                                 # With the supplied constraints:
        "cert": cert,                                 #   Verify the token with the certificate
        "iss": "xxx",                                 #   Ensure the issuer claim is the expected value
    }
)
```
```live:jwt/verify/cert/one_step:output
```

##### Round Trip - Sign and Verify
This example shows how to encode a token, verify, and decode it with the different options available.

Start with using the `io.jwt.encode_sign_raw` built-in:
```live:jwt/verify/round_trip_raw:module:hidden
```
```live:jwt/verify/round_trip_raw:query
raw_result_hs256 := io.jwt.encode_sign_raw(
    `{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}`,
    `{}`,
    `{"kty":"oct","k":"Zm9v"}`  	# "Zm9v" == base64url.encode_no_pad("foo")
)

# Important!! - Use the un-encoded plain text secret to verify and decode
raw_result_valid_hs256 := io.jwt.verify_hs256(raw_result_hs256, "foo")
raw_result_parts_hs256 := io.jwt.decode_verify(raw_result_hs256, {"secret": "foo"})
```
```live:jwt/verify/round_trip_raw:output
```

Now encode the and sign the same token contents but with `io.jwt.encode_sign` instead of the `raw` varient.
```live:jwt/verify/round_trip:module:hidden
```
```live:jwt/verify/round_trip:query:merge_down
result_hs256 := io.jwt.encode_sign(
    {
        "alg":"HS256",
        "typ":"JWT"
    },
    {},
    {
        "kty":"oct",
        "k":"Zm9v"
    }
)

# Important!! - Use the un-encoded plain text secret to verify and decode
result_parts_hs256 := io.jwt.decode_verify(result_hs256, {"secret": "foo"})
result_valid_hs256 := io.jwt.verify_hs256(result_hs256, "foo")
```
```live:jwt/verify/round_trip:output
```

> Note that the resulting encoded token is different from the first example using
> `io.jwt.encode_sign_raw`. The reason is that the `io.jwt.encode_sign` function
> is using canonicalized formatting for the header and payload whereas
> `io.jwt.encode_sign_raw` does not change the whitespace of the strings passed
> in. The decoded and parsed JSON values are still the same.

Timezones can be specified as

* an [IANA Time Zone](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) string e.g. "America/New_York"
* "UTC" or "", which are equivalent to not passing a timezone (i.e. will return as UTC)
* "Local", which will use the local timezone.

### Graphs

| Built-in | Description | Wasm Support |
| ------- |-------------|--------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``walk(x, [path, value])``</span> | ``walk`` is a relation that produces ``path`` and ``value`` pairs for documents under ``x``. ``path`` is ``array`` representing a pointer to ``value`` in ``x``.

A common class of recursive rules can be reduced to a graph reachability
problem, so `graph.reachable` is useful for more than just graph analysis.
This usually requires some pre- and postprocessing.  The following example
shows you how to "flatten" a hierarchy of access permissions.

```live:graph/reachable/example:module
package graph_reachable_example

org_chart_data = {
  "ceo": {},
  "human_resources": {"owner": "ceo", "access": ["salaries", "complaints"]},
  "staffing": {"owner": "human_resources", "access": ["interviews"]},
  "internships": {"owner": "staffing", "access": ["blog"]}
}

org_chart_graph[entity_name] = edges {
  org_chart_data[entity_name]
  edges := {neighbor | org_chart_data[neighbor].owner == entity_name}
}

org_chart_permissions[entity_name] = access {
  org_chart_data[entity_name]
  reachable := graph.reachable(org_chart_graph, {entity_name})
  access := {item | reachable[k]; item := org_chart_data[k].access[_]}
}
```
```live:graph/reachable/example:query
org_chart_permissions[entity_name]
```
```live:graph/reachable/example:output
```

It may be useful to find all reachable paths from a root element. `graph.reachable_paths` can be used for this. Note that cyclical paths will terminate on the repeated node. If an element references a nonexistent element, the path will be terminated, and excludes the nonexistent node.

```live:graph/reachable_paths/example:module
package graph_reachable_paths_example

path_data = {
    "aTop": [],
    "cMiddle": ["aTop"],
    "bBottom": ["cMiddle"],
    "dIgnored": []
}

all_paths[root] = paths {
    path_data[root]
    paths := graph.reachable_paths(path_data, {root})
}
```
```live:graph/reachable_paths/example:query
all_paths[entity_name]
```
```live:graph/reachable_paths/example:output
```

### HTTP

| Built-in | Description | Wasm Support |
| ------- |-------------|---------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``response := http.send(request)``</span> | ``http.send`` executes an HTTP `request` and returns a `response`. | ``SDK-dependent`` |

{{< danger >}}
This built-in function **must not** be used for effecting changes in
external systems as OPA does not guarantee that the statement will be executed due
to automatic performance optimizations that are applied during policy evaluation.
{{< /danger >}}

The `request` object parameter may contain the following fields:

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | yes | `string` | HTTP URL to specify in the request (e.g., `"https://www.openpolicyagent.org"`). |
| `method` | yes | `string` | HTTP method to specify in request (e.g., `"GET"`, `"POST"`, `"PUT"`, etc.) |
| `body` | no | `any` | HTTP message body to include in request. The value will be serialized to JSON. |
| `raw_body` | no | `string` | HTTP message body to include in request. The value WILL NOT be serialized. Use this for non-JSON messages. |
| `headers` | no | `object` | HTTP headers to include in the request (e.g,. `{"X-Opa": "rules"}`). |
| `enable_redirect` | no | `boolean` | Follow HTTP redirects. Default: `false`. |
| `force_json_decode` | no | `boolean` | Decode the HTTP response message body as JSON even if the `Content-Type` header is missing. Default: `false`. |
| `tls_use_system_certs` | no | `boolean` | Use the system certificate pool. Default: `true` when `tls_ca_cert`, `tls_ca_cert_file`, `tls_ca_cert_env_variable` are unset. **Ignored on Windows** due to the system certificate pool not being accessible in the same way as it is for other platforms. |
| `tls_ca_cert` | no | `string` | String containing a root certificate in PEM encoded format. |
| `tls_ca_cert_file` | no | `string` | Path to file containing a root certificate in PEM encoded format. |
| `tls_ca_cert_env_variable` | no | `string` | Environment variable containing a root certificate in PEM encoded format. |
| `tls_client_cert` | no | `string` | String containing a client certificate in PEM encoded format. |
| `tls_client_cert_file` | no | `string` | Path to file containing a client certificate in PEM encoded format. |
| `tls_client_cert_env_variable` | no | `string` | Environment variable containing a client certificate in PEM encoded format. |
| `tls_client_key` | no | `string` | String containing a key in PEM encoded format. |
| `tls_client_key_file` | no | `string` | Path to file containing a key in PEM encoded format. |
| `tls_client_key_env_variable` | no | `string` | Environment variable containing a client key in PEM encoded format. |
| `timeout` | no | `string` or `number` | Timeout for the HTTP request with a default of 5 seconds (`5s`). Numbers provided are in nanoseconds. Strings must be a valid duration string where a duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". A zero timeout means no timeout.|
| `tls_insecure_skip_verify` | no | `bool` | Allows for skipping TLS verification when calling a network endpoint. Not recommended for production. |
| `tls_server_name` | no | `string` | Sets the hostname that is sent in the client Server Name Indication and that be will be used for server certificate validation. If this is not set, the value of the `Host` header (if present) will be used. If neither are set, the host name from the requested URL is used. |
| `cache` | no | `boolean` | Cache HTTP response across OPA queries. Default: `false`. |
| `force_cache` | no | `boolean` | Cache HTTP response across OPA queries and override cache directives defined by the server. Default: `false`. |
| `force_cache_duration_seconds` | no | `number` | If `force_cache` is set, this field specifies the duration in seconds for the freshness of a cached response. |
| `caching_mode` | no | `string` | Controls the format in which items are inserted into the inter-query cache. Allowed modes are `serialized` and `deserialized`. In the `serialized` mode, items will be serialized before inserting into the cache. This mode is helpful if memory conservation is preferred over higher latency during cache lookup. This is the default mode. In the `deserialized` mode, an item will be inserted in the cache without any serialization. This means when items are fetched from the cache, there won't be a need to decode them. This mode helps to make the cache lookup faster at the expense of more memory consumption. If this mode is enabled, the configured `caching.inter_query_builtin_cache.max_size_bytes` value will be ignored. This means an unlimited cache size will be assumed. |
| `raise_error` | no | `bool` | If `raise_error` is set, errors returned by `http.send` will halt policy evaluation. Default: `true`. |

If the `Host` header is included in `headers`, its value will be used as the `Host` header of the request. The `url` parameter will continue to specify the server to connect to.

When sending HTTPS requests with client certificates at least one the following combinations must be included

 * ``tls_client_cert`` and ``tls_client_key``
 * ``tls_client_cert_file`` and ``tls_client_key_file``
 * ``tls_client_cert_env_variable`` and ``tls_client_key_env_variable``

> To validate TLS server certificates, the user must also provide trusted root CA certificates through the ``tls_ca_cert``, ``tls_ca_cert_file`` and ``tls_ca_cert_env_variable`` fields. If the ``tls_use_system_certs`` field is ``true``, the system certificate pool will be used as well as any additional CA certificates.

The `response` object parameter will contain the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `string` | HTTP status message (e.g., `"200 OK"`). |
| `status_code` | `number` | HTTP status code (e.g., `200`). If `raise_error` is `false`, this field will be set to `0` if `http.send` encounters an error. |
| `body` | `any` | Any JSON value. If the HTTP response message body was not deserialized from JSON, this field is set to `null`. |
| `raw_body` | `string` | The entire raw HTTP response message body represented as a string. |
| `headers` | `object` | An object containing the response headers. The values will be an array of strings, repeated headers are grouped under the same keys with all values in the array. |
| `error` | `object` | If `raise_error` is `false`, this field will represent the error encountered while running `http.send`. The `error` object contains a `message` key which holds the actual error message and a `code` key which represents if the error was caused due to a network issue or during policy evaluation. |

By default, an error returned by `http.send` halts the policy evaluation. This behaviour can be altered such that
instead of halting evaluation, if `http.send` encounters an error, it can return a `response` object with `status_code`
set to `0` and `error` describing the actual error. This can be activated by setting the `raise_error` field
in the `request` object to `false`.

If the `cache` field in the `request` object is `true`, `http.send` will return a cached response after it checks its freshness and validity.

`http.send` uses the `Cache-Control` and `Expires` response headers to check the freshness of the cached response.
Specifically if the [max-age](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2.2.8) `Cache-Control` directive is set, `http.send`
will use it to determine if the cached response is fresh or not. If `max-age` is not set, the `Expires` header will be used instead.

If the cached response is stale, `http.send` uses the `Etag` and `Last-Modified` response headers to check with the server if the
cached response is in fact still fresh. If the server responds with a `200` (`OK`) response, `http.send` will update the cache
with the new response. On a `304` (`Not Modified`) server response, `http.send` will update the headers in cached response with
their corresponding values in the `304` response.

The `force_cache` field can be used to override the cache directives defined by the server. This field is used in
conjunction with the `force_cache_duration_seconds` field. If `force_cache` is `true`, then `force_cache_duration_seconds`
**must** be specified and `http.send` will use this value to check the freshness of the cached response.

Also, if `force_cache` is `true`, it overrides the `cache` field.

> `http.send` uses the `Date` response header to calculate the current age of the response by comparing it with the current time.
> This value is used to determine the freshness of the cached response. As per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.2,
> an origin server MUST NOT send a `Date` header field if it does not have a clock capable of providing a reasonable
> approximation of the current instance in Coordinated Universal Time. Hence, if `http.send` encounters a scenario where current
> age of the response is represented as a negative duration, the cached response will be considered as stale.

The table below shows examples of calling `http.send`:

### Net

| Built-in | Description | Wasm Support |
| ------- |-------------|---------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``net.lookup_ip_addr(name)``</span> | `output` is a set of IP addresses (both v4 and v6, strings) that the domain name resolves to using standard name resolution, [see the notes below](#notes-on-name-resolution-netlookup_ip_addr). | ``SDK-dependent`` |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``net.cidr_contains(cidr, cidr_or_ip)``</span> | `output` is `true` if `cidr_or_ip` (e.g. `127.0.0.64/26` or `127.0.0.1`) is contained within `cidr` (e.g. `127.0.0.1/24`) and false otherwise. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 notations.| ✅ |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := net.cidr_contains_matches(cidrs, cidrs_or_ips)``</span> | `output` is a `set` of tuples identifying matches where `cidrs_or_ips` are contained within `cidrs`. This function is similar to `net.cidr_contains` except it allows callers to pass collections of CIDRs or IPs as arguments and returns the matches (as opposed to a boolean result indicating a match between two CIDRs/IPs.) See below for examples. | ``SDK-dependent`` |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``net.cidr_intersects(cidr1, cidr2)``</span> | `output` is `true` if `cidr1` (e.g. `192.168.0.0/16`) overlaps with `cidr2` (e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`) and false otherwise. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 notations.| ✅ |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``net.cidr_expand(cidr)``</span> | `output` is the set of hosts in `cidr`  (e.g., `net.cidr_expand("192.168.0.0/30")` generates 4 hosts: `{"192.168.0.0", "192.168.0.1", "192.168.0.2", "192.168.0.3"}` | ``SDK-dependent`` |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``net.cidr_merge(cidrs_or_ips)``</span> | `output` is the smallest possible set of CIDRs obtained after merging the provided list of IP addresses and subnets in `cidrs_or_ips`  (e.g., `net.cidr_merge(["192.0.128.0/24", "192.0.129.0/24"])` generates `{"192.0.128.0/23"}`. This function merges adjacent subnets where possible, those contained within others and also removes any duplicates. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 notations. | ``SDK-dependent`` |

#### Notes on Name Resolution (`net.lookup_ip_addr`)

The lookup mechanism uses either the pure-Go, or the cgo-based resolver, depending on the operating system and availability of cgo.
The latter depends on flags that can be provided when building OPA as a Go library, and can be adjusted at runtime via the GODEBUG enviroment variable.
See [these docs on the `net` package](https://pkg.go.dev/net@go1.17.3#hdr-Name_Resolution) for details.

Note that the cgo-based resolver is often **preferrable**: It will take advantage of host-based DNS caching in place.
This built-in function only caches DNS lookups within _a single_ policy evaluation.

#### Examples of `net.cidr_contains_matches`

The `output := net.cidr_contains_matches(a, b)` function allows callers to supply
strings, arrays, sets, or objects for either `a` or `b`. The `output` value in
all cases is a set of tuples (2-element arrays) that identify matches, i.e.,
elements of `b` contained by elements of `a`. The first tuple element refers to
the match in `a` and the second tuple element refers to the match in `b`.

| Input Type | Output Type |
| --- | --- |
| `string` | `string` |
| `array` | `array` index |
| `set` | `set` element |
| `object` | `object` key |


```live:netcidrcontainsmatches:module:hidden
package netcidrcontainsmatches
```

If both operands are string values the function is similar to `net.cidr_contains`.

```live:netcidrcontainsmatches/strings:query:merge_down
net.cidr_contains_matches("1.1.1.0/24", "1.1.1.128")
```
```live:netcidrcontainsmatches/strings:output
```

Either (or both) operand(s) may be an array, set, or object.

```live:netcidrcontainsmatches/array:query:merge_down
net.cidr_contains_matches(["1.1.1.0/24", "1.1.2.0/24"], "1.1.1.128")
```
```live:netcidrcontainsmatches/array:output
```

The array/set/object elements may be arrays. In that case, the first element must be a valid CIDR/IP.

```live:netcidrcontainsmatches/tuples:query:merge_down
net.cidr_contains_matches([["1.1.0.0/16", "foo"], "1.1.2.0/24"], ["1.1.1.128", ["1.1.254.254", "bar"]])
```
```live:netcidrcontainsmatches/tuples:output
```

If the operand is a set, the outputs are matching elements. If the operand is an object, the outputs are matching keys.

```live:netcidrcontainsmatches/sets_and_objects:query:merge_down
net.cidr_contains_matches({["1.1.0.0/16", "foo"], "1.1.2.0/24"}, {"x": "1.1.1.128", "y": ["1.1.254.254", "bar"]})
```
```live:netcidrcontainsmatches/sets_and_objects:output:merge_down
```

### UUID

| Built-in | Description | Wasm Support |
| ------- |-------------|---------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := uuid.rfc4122(str)``</span> | ``output`` is ``string`` representing a version 4 uuid. For any given str the output will be consistent throughout a query evaluation. | ``SDK-dependent`` |

### Semantic Versions

| Built-in | Description | Wasm Support |
| ------- |-------------|---------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := semver.is_valid(str)``</span> | ``output`` is a ``boolean``. ``true`` means the input is a valid SemVer string (e.g. "1.0.0"). ``false`` is returned for invalid version strings and non-string input. | ``SDK-dependent`` |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := semver.compare(str, str)``</span> | ``output`` is a ``number``. ``-1`` means the version in the first operand is less than the second. ``1`` means the version in the first operand is greater than the second. ``0`` means the versions are equal. Only valid SemVer strings are accepted e.g. ``1.2.3`` or ``0.1.0`` | ``SDK-dependent`` |

### Rego

| Built-in | Description | Wasm Support |
| ------- |-------------|---------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := rego.parse_module(filename, string)``</span> | ``rego.parse_module`` parses the input ``string`` as a Rego module and returns the AST as a JSON object ``output``. | ``SDK-dependent`` |

### OPA

| Built-in | Description | Wasm Support |
| ------- |-------------|---------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := opa.runtime()``</span> | ``opa.runtime`` returns a JSON object ``output`` that describes the runtime environment where OPA is deployed. **Caution**: Policies that depend on the output of ``opa.runtime`` may return different answers depending on how OPA was started. If possible, prefer using an explicit `input` or `data` value instead of `opa.runtime`. The ``output`` of ``opa.runtime`` will include a ``"config"`` key if OPA was started with a configuration file. The ``output`` of ``opa.runtime`` will include a ``"env"`` key containing the environment variables that the OPA process was started with. The ``output`` of ``opa.runtime`` will include ``"version"`` and ``"commit"`` keys containing the semantic version and build commit of OPA. | ``SDK-dependent`` |

### Debugging

| Built-in | Description | Wasm Support |
| ------- |-------------|---------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``print(...)``</span> | ``print`` is used to output the values of variables for debugging purposes. ``print`` calls have no affect on the result of queries or rules. All variables passed to `print` must be assigned inside of the query or rule. If any of the `print` arguments are undefined, their values are represented as `<undefined>` in the output stream. Because policies can be invoked via different interfaces (e.g., CLI, HTTP API, etc.) the exact output format differs. See the table below for details. | ``SDK-dependent`` |

API | Output | Memo
--- | --- | ---
`opa eval` | `stderr` |
`opa run` (REPL)  | `stderr` |
`opa test` | `stdout` | Specify `-v` to see output for passing tests. Output for failing tests is displayed automatically.
`opa run -s` (server) | `stderr` | Specify `--log-level=info` (default) or higher. Output is sent to the log stream. Use `--log-format=text` for pretty output.
Go (library) | `io.Writer` | [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego#example-Rego-Print_statements](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego#example-Rego-Print_statements)

### Tracing

| Built-in | Description | Wasm Support |
| ------- |-------------|---------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``trace(string)``</span> | ``trace`` emits ``string`` as a ``Note`` event in the query explanation. Query explanations show the exact expressions evaluated by OPA during policy execution. For example, ``trace("Hello There!")`` includes ``Note "Hello There!"`` in the query explanation. To include variables in the message, use ``sprintf``. For example, ``person := "Bob"; trace(sprintf("Hello There! %v", [person]))`` will emit ``Note "Hello There! Bob"`` inside of the explanation. | ``SDK-dependent`` |

By default, explanations are disabled. The following table summarizes how you can enable tracing:

API | Parameter | Example | Memo
--- | --- | --- | ---
CLI | `--explain` | `opa eval --explain=notes --format=pretty 'trace("hello world")'` |
HTTP | `explain=notes` | `curl localhost:8181/v1/data/example/allow?explain=notes&pretty` |
REPL | `notes` | n/a | The "notes" command enables trace explanations. See `help` for more details.

## Grammar

Rego’s syntax is defined by the following grammar:

```ebnf
module          = package { import } policy
package         = "package" ref
import          = "import" package [ "as" var ]
policy          = { rule }
rule            = [ "default" ] rule-head { rule-body }
rule-head       = var [ "(" rule-args ")" ] [ "[" term "]" ] [ ( ":=" | "=" ) term ]
rule-args       = term { "," term }
rule-body       = [ "else" [ "=" term ] ] "{" query "}"
query           = literal { ( ";" | ( [CR] LF ) ) literal }
literal         = ( some-decl | expr | "not" expr ) { with-modifier }
with-modifier   = "with" term "as" term
some-decl       = "some" var { "," var }
expr            = term | expr-call | expr-infix
expr-call       = var [ "." var ] "(" [ term { "," term } ] ")"
expr-infix      = [ term "=" ] term infix-operator term
term            = ref | var | scalar | array | object | set | array-compr | object-compr | set-compr
array-compr     = "[" term "|" rule-body "]"
set-compr       = "{" term "|" rule-body "}"
object-compr    = "{" object-item "|" rule-body "}"
infix-operator  = bool-operator | arith-operator | bin-operator
bool-operator   = "==" | "!=" | "<" | ">" | ">=" | "<="
arith-operator  = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
bin-operator    = "&" | "|"
ref             = ( var | array | object | set | array-compr | object-compr | set-compr | expr-call ) { ref-arg }
ref-arg         = ref-arg-dot | ref-arg-brack
ref-arg-brack   = "[" ( scalar | var | array | object | set | "_" ) "]"
ref-arg-dot     = "." var
var             = ( ALPHA | "_" ) { ALPHA | DIGIT | "_" }
scalar          = string | NUMBER | TRUE | FALSE | NULL
string          = STRING | raw-string
raw-string      = "`" { CHAR-"`" } "`"
array           = "[" term { "," term } "]"
object          = "{" object-item { "," object-item } "}"
object-item     = ( scalar | ref | var ) ":" term
set             = empty-set | non-empty-set
non-empty-set   = "{" term { "," term } "}"
empty-set       = "set(" ")"
```

The grammar defined above makes use of the following syntax. See [the Wikipedia page on EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_Form) for more details:

```
[]     optional (zero or one instances)
{}     repetition (zero or more instances)
|      alternation (one of the instances)
()     grouping (order of expansion)
STRING JSON string
NUMBER JSON number
TRUE   JSON true
FALSE  JSON false
NULL   JSON null
CHAR   Unicode character
ALPHA  ASCII characters A-Z and a-z
DIGIT  ASCII characters 0-9
CR     Carriage Return
LF     Line Feed
```
