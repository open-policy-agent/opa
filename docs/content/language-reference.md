This document is the authoritative specification of the Rego policy language
(V1). All policies in OPA are written in Rego.

## Built-in Functions

The built-in functions for the language provide basic operations to manipulate
scalar values (e.g. numbers and strings), and aggregate functions that summarize
complex types.

If ``length`` is less than zero, ``length`` is the remainder of the ``string``. If ``start`` is greater than the length of the string, ``output`` is empty. It is invalid to pass a negative offset to this function. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := trim(string, cutset)``</span> | ``output`` is a ``string`` representing ``string`` with all leading and trailing instances of the characters in ``cutset`` removed. |

| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``regex.globs_match(glob1, glob2)``</span> | true if the intersection of regex-style globs ``glob1`` and ``glob2`` matches a non-empty set of non-empty strings. The set of regex symbols is limited for this builtin: only ``.``, ``*``, ``+``, ``[``, ``-``, ``]`` and ``\`` are treated as special symbols. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-normal">``output := regex.template_match(patter, string, delimiter_start, delimiter_end)``</span> | ``output`` is true if ``string`` matches ``pattern``. ``pattern`` is a string containing ``0..n`` regular expressions delimited by ``delimiter_start`` and ``delimiter_end``. Example ``regex.template_match("urn:foo:{.*}", "urn:foo:bar:baz", "{", "}", x)`` returns ``true`` for ``x``. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := regex.find_n(pattern, string, number)``</span> | ``output`` is an ``array[string]`` with the ``number`` of values matching the ``pattern``. A ``number`` of ``-1`` means all matches. |

### Glob
| Built-in | Description |
| ------- |-------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := glob.match(pattern, delimiters, match)``</span> | ``output`` is true if ``match`` can be found in ``pattern`` which is separated by ``delimiters``. For valid patterns, check the table below. Argument ``delimiters`` is an array of single-characters (e.g. `[".", ":"]`). If ``delimiters`` is empty, it defaults to ``["."]``. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := glob.quote_meta(pattern)``</span> | ``output`` is the escaped string of ``pattern``. Calling ``glob.quote_meta("*.github.com", output)`` returns ``\\*.github.com`` as ``output``. |

### Tokens

| Built-in | Description |
| ------- |-------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := io.jwt.verify_rs256(string, certificate)``</span> | ``output`` is ``true`` if the RS256 signature of the input token is valid. ``certificate`` is the PEM encoded certificate used to verify the RS256 signature|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := io.jwt.verify_ps256(string, certificate)``</span> | ``output`` is ``true`` if the PS256 signature of the input token is valid. ``certificate`` is the PEM encoded certificate used to verify the PS256 signature|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := io.jwt.verify_es256(string, certificate)``</span> | ``output`` is ``true`` if the ES256 signature of the input token is valid. ``certificate`` is the PEM encoded certificate used to verify the ES256 signature|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := io.jwt.verify_hs256(string, secret)``</span> | ``output`` is ``true`` if the Secret signature of the input token is valid. ``secret`` is a plain text secret used to verify the HS256 signature|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := io.jwt.decode(string)``</span> | ``output`` is of the form ``[header, payload, sig]``.  ``header`` and ``payload`` are ``object``. ``sig`` is the hexadecimal representation of the signature on the token. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := io.jwt.decode_verify(string, constraints)``</span> | ``output`` is of the form ``[valid, header, payload]``.  If the input token verifies and meets the requirements of ``constraints`` then ``valid`` is ``true`` and ``header`` and ``payload`` are objects containing the JOSE header and the JWT claim set. Otherwise, ``valid`` is ``false`` and ``header`` and ``payload`` are ``{}``. |

The input `string` is a JSON Web Token encoded with JWS Compact Serialization. JWE and JWS JSON Serialization are not supported. If nested signing was used, the ``header``, ``payload`` and ``signature`` will represent the most deeply nested token.

For ``io.jwt.decode_verify``, ``constraints`` is an object with the following members:

| Name | Meaning | Required |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| ``cert`` | A PEM encoded certificate containing an RSA or ECDSA public key. | See below |
| ``secret`` | The secret key for HS256, HS384 and HS512 verification. | See below |
| ``alg`` | The JWA algorithm name to use. If it is absent then any algorithm that is compatible with the key is accepted. | Optional |
| ``iss`` | The issuer string. If it is present the only tokens with this issuer are accepted. If it is absent then any issuer is accepted. | Optional |
|``time`` | The time in nanoseconds to verify the token at. If this is present then the ``exp`` and ``nbf`` claims are compared against this value. If it is absent then they are compared against the current time. | Optional |
|``aud`` | The audience that the verifier identifies with.  If this is present then the ``aud`` claim is checked against it. If it is absent then the ``aud`` claim must be absent too. | Optional |

Exactly one of ``cert`` and ``secret`` must be present.
If there are any unrecognized constraints then the token is considered invalid.

### Time

| Built-in | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := time.now_ns()``</span> | ``output`` is ``number`` representing the current time since epoch in nanoseconds. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := time.parse_ns(layout, value)``</span> | ``output`` is ``number`` representing the time ``value`` in nanoseconds since epoch. See the [Go `time` package documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Parse) for more details on ``layout``. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := time.parse_rfc3339_ns(value)``</span> | ``output`` is ``number`` representing the time ``value`` in nanoseconds since epoch. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := time.parse_duration_ns(duration)``</span> | ``output`` is ``number`` representing the duration ``duration`` in nanoseconds. See the [Go `time` package documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) for more details on ``duration``. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := time.date(ns)``<br/>``output := time.date([ns, tz])``</span> | ``output`` is of the form ``[year, month, day]``, which includes the ``year``, ``month`` (0-12), and ``day`` (0-31) as ``number``s representing the date from the nanoseconds since epoch (``ns``) in the timezone (``tz``), if supplied, or as UTC.|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := time.clock(ns)``<br/>``output := time.clock([ns, tz])``</span> | ``output`` is of the form ``[hour, minute, second]``, which outputs the ``hour``, ``minute`` (0-59), and ``second`` (0-59) as ``number``s representing the time of day for the nanoseconds since epoch (``ns``) in the timezone (``tz``), if supplied, or as UTC. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``day := time.weekday(ns)``<br/>``day := time.weekday([ns, tz])``</span> | outputs the ``day`` as ``string`` representing the day of the week for the nanoseconds since epoch (``ns``) in the timezone (``tz``), if supplied, or as UTC. |

> Multiple calls to the `time.now_ns` built-in function within a single policy
evaluation query will always return the same value.

Timezones can be specified as

* an [IANA Time Zone](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) string e.g. "America/New_York"
* "UTC" or "", which are equivalent to not passing a timezone (i.e. will return as UTC)
* "Local", which will use the local timezone.

Note that the opa executable will need access to the timezone files in the environment it is running in (see the [Go time.LoadLocation()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#LoadLocation) documentation for more information).

### Cryptography

| Built-in | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``output := crypto.x509.parse_certificates(string)``</span> | ``output`` is an array of X.509 certificates represented as JSON objects. |

### Graphs

| Built-in | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``walk(x, [path, value])``</span> | ``walk`` is a relation that produces ``path`` and ``value`` pairs for documents under ``x``. ``path`` is ``array`` representing a pointer to ``value`` in ``x``.  Queries can use ``walk`` to traverse documents nested under ``x`` (recursively). |

### HTTP

| Built-in | Description |
| ------- |-------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``http.send(request, output)``</span> | ``http.send`` executes a HTTP request and returns the response.``request`` is an object containing keys ``method``, ``url`` and  optionally ``body``, ``enable_redirect``, ``force_json_decode``, ``headers``, ``tls_use_system_certs``, ``tls_ca_cert_file``, ``tls_ca_cert_env_variable``, ``tls_client_cert_env_variable``, ``tls_client_key_env_variable`` or ``tls_client_cert_file``, ``tls_client_key_file`` . For example, ``http.send({"method": "get", "url": "http://www.openpolicyagent.org/", "headers": {"X-Foo":"bar", "X-Opa": "rules"}}, output)``. ``output`` is an object containing keys ``status``, ``status_code``, ``body`` and ``raw_body`` which represent the HTTP status, status code, JSON value from the response body and response body as string respectively. Sample output, ``{"status": "200 OK", "status_code": 200, "body": {"hello": "world"}, "raw_body": "{\"hello\": \"world\"}"``}. By default, HTTP redirects are not enabled. To enable, set ``enable_redirect`` to ``true``. Also ``force_json_decode`` is set to ``false`` by default. This means if the HTTP server response does not specify the ``Content-type`` as ``application/json``, the response body will not be JSON decoded ie. output's ``body`` field will be ``null``. To change this behaviour, set ``force_json_decode`` to ``true``.|

#### HTTPs Usage

The following table explains the HTTPs objects

| Object |  Definition | Value|
| -------- |-----------|------|
| tls_use_system_certs | Use system certificate pool | true or false
| tls_ca_cert_file | Path to file containing a root certificate in PEM encoded format | double-quoted string
| tls_ca_cert_env_variable | Environment variable containing a root certificate in PEM encoded format | double-quoted string
| tls_client_cert_env_variable | Environment variable containing a client certificate in PEM encoded format | double-quoted string
| tls_client_key_env_variable | Environment variable containing a client key in PEM encoded format | double-quoted string
| tls_client_cert_file | Path to file containing a client certificate in PEM encoded format | double-quoted string
| tls_client_key_file | Path to file containing a key  in PEM encoded format | double-quoted string

In order to trigger the use of HTTPs the user must provide one of the following combinations:

 * ``tls_client_cert_file``, ``tls_client_key_file``
 * ``tls_client_cert_env_variable``, ``tls_client_key_env_variable``

 The user must also provide a trusted root CA through tls_ca_cert_file or tls_ca_cert_env_variable. Alternatively the user could set tls_use_system_certs to ``true`` and the system certificate pool will be used.

| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``trace(string)``</span> | ``trace`` outputs the debug message ``string`` as a ``Note`` event in the query explanation. For example, ``trace("Hello There!")`` includes ``Note "Hello There!"`` in the query explanation. To print variables, use sprintf. For example, ``person := "Bob"; trace(sprintf("Hello There! %v", [person]))`` will emit ``Note "Hello There! Bob"``. |

## Grammar

Rego’s syntax is defined by the following grammar:

```
module          = package { import } policy
package         = "package" ref
import          = "import" package [ "as" var ]
policy          = { rule }
rule            = [ "default" ] rule-head { rule-body }
rule-head       = var [ "(" rule-args ")" ] [ "[" term "]" ] [ = term ]
rule-args       = term { "," term }
rule-body       = [ else [ = term ] ] "{" query "}"
query           = literal { ";" | [\r\n] literal }
literal         = ( some-decl | expr | "not" expr ) { with-modifier }
with-modifier   = "with" term "as" term
some-decl       = "some" var { "," var }
expr            = term | expr-built-in | expr-infix
expr-built-in   = var [ "." var ] "(" [ term { , term } ] ")"
expr-infix      = [ term "=" ] term infix-operator term
term            = ref | var | scalar | array | object | set | array-compr | object-compr | set-compr
array-compr     = "[" term "|" rule-body "]"
set-compr       = "{" term "|" rule-body "}"
object-compr    = "{" object-item "|" rule-body "}"
infix-operator  = bool-operator | arith-operator | bin-operator
bool-operator   = "=" | "!=" | "<" | ">" | ">=" | "<="
arith-operator  = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
bin-operator    = "&" | "|"
ref             = var { ref-arg }
ref-arg         = ref-arg-dot | ref-arg-brack
ref-arg-brack   = "[" ( scalar | var | array | object | set | "_" ) "]"
ref-arg-dot     = "." var
var             = ( ALPHA | "_" ) { ALPHA | DIGIT | "_" }
scalar          = string | NUMBER | TRUE | FALSE | NULL
string          = STRING | raw-string
raw-string      = "`" { CHAR-"`" } "`"
array           = "[" term { "," term } "]"
object          = "{" object-item { "," object-item } "}"
object-item     = ( scalar | ref | var ) ":" term
set             = empty-set | non-empty-set
non-empty-set   = "{" term { "," term } "}"
empty-set       = "set(" ")"
```

The grammar defined above makes use of the following syntax. See [the Wikipedia page on EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_Form) for more details:

```
[]     optional (zero or one instances)
{}     repetition (zero or more instances)
|      alternation (one of the instances)
()     grouping (order of expansion)
STRING JSON string
NUMBER JSON number
TRUE   JSON true
FALSE  JSON false
NULL   JSON null
CHAR   Unicode character
ALPHA  ASCII characters A-Z and a-z
DIGIT  ASCII characters 0-9
```
