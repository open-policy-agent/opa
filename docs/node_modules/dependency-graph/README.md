# Dependency Graph

Simple dependency graph

## Overview

This is a simple dependency graph useful for determining the order to do a list of things that depend on certain items being done before they are.

To use, `npm install dependency-graph` and then `require('dependency-graph').DepGraph`

## API

### DepGraph

Nodes in the graph are just simple strings with optional data associated with them.

 - `addNode(name, data)` - add a node in the graph with optional data. If `data` is not given, `name` will be used as data
 - `removeNode(name)` - remove a node from the graph
 - `hasNode(name)` - check if a node exists in the graph
 - `size()` - return the number of nodes in the graph
 - `getNodeData(name)` - get the data associated with a node (will throw an `Error` if the node does not exist)
 - `setNodeData(name, data)` - set the data for an existing node (will throw an `Error` if the node does not exist)
 - `addDependency(from, to)` - add a dependency between two nodes (will throw an `Error` if one of the nodes does not exist)
 - `removeDependency(from, to)` - remove a dependency between two nodes
 - `clone()` - return a clone of the graph. Any data attached to the nodes will only be *shallow-copied*
 - `dependenciesOf(name, leavesOnly)` - get an array containing the nodes that the specified node depends on (transitively). If `leavesOnly` is true, only nodes that do not depend on any other nodes will be returned in the array.
 - `dependantsOf(name, leavesOnly)` - get an array containing the nodes that depend on the specified node (transitively). If `leavesOnly` is true, only nodes that do not have any dependants will be returned in the array.
 - `overallOrder(leavesOnly)` - construct the overall processing order for the dependency graph. If `leavesOnly` is true, only nodes that do not depend on any other nodes will be returned.

Dependency Cycles are detected when running `dependenciesOf`, `dependantsOf`, and `overallOrder` and if one is found, a `DepGraphCycleError` will be thrown that includes what the cycle was in the message as well as the `cyclePath` property: e.g. `Dependency Cycle Found: a -> b -> c -> a`. If you wish to silence this error, pass `circular: true` when instantiating `DepGraph` (more below).

## Examples

    var DepGraph = require('dependency-graph').DepGraph;

    var graph = new DepGraph();
    graph.addNode('a');
    graph.addNode('b');
    graph.addNode('c');

    graph.size() // 3

    graph.addDependency('a', 'b');
    graph.addDependency('b', 'c');

    graph.dependenciesOf('a'); // ['c', 'b']
    graph.dependenciesOf('b'); // ['c']
    graph.dependantsOf('c'); // ['a', 'b']

    graph.overallOrder(); // ['c', 'b', 'a']
    graph.overallOrder(true); // ['c']

    graph.addNode('d', 'data');

    graph.getNodeData('d'); // 'data'

    graph.setNodeData('d', 'newData');

    graph.getNodeData('d'); // 'newData'

    var circularGraph = new DepGraph({ circular: true });

    circularGraph.addNode('a');
    circularGraph.addNode('b');
    circularGraph.addNode('c');
    circularGraph.addNode('d');

    circularGraph.addDependency('a', 'b');
    circularGraph.addDependency('b', 'c'); // b depends on c
    circularGraph.addDependency('c', 'a'); // c depends on a, which depends on b
    circularGraph.addDependency('d', 'a');

    circularGraph.dependenciesOf('b'); // ['a', 'c']
    circularGraph.overallOrder(); // ['c', 'b', 'a', 'd']
