This example shows how `base64.encode` acts as a utility function to bridge communication between client and server when they don't speak the same language.

**The scenario:** A client sends credentials in custom headers (`x-username`, `x-password`), but the downstream service expects HTTP Basic Authentication. OPA and Envoy work together to translate between these formats using base64 encoding.

**Why this is useful:** This pattern is common in API gateways where you need to adapt between different authentication schemes. The `base64.encode` function transforms the data into the format expected by the downstream service, enabling seamless integration.
