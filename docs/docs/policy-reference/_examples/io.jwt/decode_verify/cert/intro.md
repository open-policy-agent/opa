Some users may prefer to use a certificate to verify the JWT token. This example
shows how to use a certificate to verify the JWT. Much like the other examples,
it only checks the `iss` claim.

<sub>
Note: You can generate your own certificate and signed JWT for testing using the
example code [here](https://go.dev/play/p/HMAPqDJM3jk).
