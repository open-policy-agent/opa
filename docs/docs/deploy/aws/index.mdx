title: Deploying OPA on AWS
---

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is easily integrated with systems running in
Amazon Web Services (AWS). OPA exposes APIs for policy evaluation and can be
invoked over the network from a range of AWS services.

OPA can be deployed on a range of different AWS services. Choosing the right one
for your use case depends on:

- Where the calling service is running
- The latency requirements of the calling service
- What the data volume required at policy evaluation time

The table below outlines maps different use cases to one of the three main
deployment options for OPA on AWS.

| **Use Case**              | **Deployment Method**                    |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| EC2 application           | Local Node Agent or Centralized Service  |
| AWS API Gateway           | ECS Service                              |
| EKS application           | Local OPA Sidecar or Centralized Service |
| Lambda application        | ECS Service                              |
| Other custom applications | Centralized Service on EKS or ECS        |
