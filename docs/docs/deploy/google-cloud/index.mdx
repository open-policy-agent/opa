title: Deploying OPA on Google Cloud
---

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is easily integrated with systems running in Google
Cloud Platform (GCP). OPA exposes APIs for policy evaluation and can be invoked
over the network from a range of GCP services.

OPA can be deployed on a range of different GCP services. Choosing the right one
for your use case depends on:

- Where the calling service is running
- The latency requirements of the calling service
- The data volume required at policy evaluation time

The table below outlines different use cases and the recommended deployment
options for OPA on GCP.

| **Use Case**               | **Deployment Method**                    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GKE application            | Local OPA Sidecar or Centralized Service |
| Compute Engine application | Local Node Agent or Centralized Service  |
| Cloud Run application      | Local OPA Instance or Centralized Service|
| Cloud Functions            | Centralized Service on GKE or Cloud Run  |
| Other custom applications  | Centralized Service on GKE or Cloud Run  |
