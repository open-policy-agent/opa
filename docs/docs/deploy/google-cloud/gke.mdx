## Creating a Load Balancer for and OPA Cluster service

If running OPA as a cluster service, you might be interested in exposing the
service to the internet or other, internal, off-cluster PEPs. Generally, OPA is
invoked by other PEP applications rather than clients, and so a public IP is
generally not required.


```yaml title="Internal Load Balancer Service"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: opa
  annotations:
    // highlight-next-line
    networking.gke.io/load-balancer-type: "Internal"
spec:
  selector:
    app: opa
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8181
      targetPort: 8181
  type: LoadBalancer
```

:::warning
If you are exposing and OPA service to the public internet, you are advised to
make use of OPA's build in
[authentication and authorization](../../security/#authentication-and-authorization)
features if not running OPA behind another service that provides these
functions.
