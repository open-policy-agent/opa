title: Deploying OPA on Azure
---

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is easily integrated with systems running in Microsoft
Azure. OPA exposes APIs for policy evaluation and can be invoked over the
network from a range of Azure services.

OPA can be deployed on a variety of Azure services. Choosing the right
deployment method depends on:

- Where the calling service is running
- The latency requirements of the calling service
- The data volume required at policy evaluation time

The table below outlines different use cases and the recommended deployment
options for OPA on Azure.

| **Use Case**               | **Deployment Method**                    |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| AKS application            | Local OPA Sidecar or Centralized Service |
| Azure App Service          | Local Node Agent or Centralized Service  |
| Azure Functions            | Centralized Service on AKS or Container Apps |
| Azure Virtual Machines     | Local Node Agent or Centralized Service  |
| Other custom applications  | Centralized Service on AKS or Container Apps |
