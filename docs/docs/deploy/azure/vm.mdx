title: Deploying OPA on Azure Virtual Machines
---

In this section, we'll cover deployment Open Policy Agent (OPA) on Azure Virtual
Machines (VMs). Azure VMs offer a versatile platform to run an OPA Policy
Decision Point (PDP) outside of containerized environments. Running OPA on an
Azure VM is a common pattern for the following scenarios:

- OPA needs to run alongside an existing application or Policy Enforcement Point
  (PEP) on the same VM to ensure low latency for policy evaluations.
- Your organization already has a well-defined Azure deployment process, and you
  are adding OPA to your toolset.
- You want a straightforward way to set up OPA quickly for testing or
  development on Azure.

This guide will cover the steps to set up and manage OPA as a PDP on an Azure
VM.


## Choosing a VM Image

While OPA can run on nearly any Azure VM image, a x64 Linux-based image is
recommended. Additionally, using a service manager is recommended to ensure it
starts at boot time and restarts if it crashes. This guide uses Systemd, which
is included in most commonly used Linux-based images on Azure. Please note that
older operating systems like Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, and CentOS 6 do not
support Systemd and are not covered in this guide.

If uncertain about the image to use, the latest Debian or Ubuntu images on Azure
are suitable for running OPA.


## Selecting a VM Size

The VM size you choose will depend on the expected load and memory requirements
of the data needed for policy evaluation. Although OPA itself is lightweight,
data requirements for policy evaluation can vary significantly, especially with
larger datasets of users, roles, and other entities.

Users are encouraged to benchmark memory usage for OPA with their specific data.
For more information, refer to
[OPA Resource Utilization](../../policy-performance/#resource-utilization).

Using a VM smaller than `DS1_v2` (1 vCPU and 3.5GB RAM) is generally not
recommended.

:::info
If you intend to run OPA alongside another application within the same
VM, consider testing performance to ensure OPA does not impact the application.
Choose a larger VM size as needed.

## Networking Considerations

**Public IP Addresses**: OPA deployments usually do not require public IP
addresses. PEPs calling OPA are generally other internal Azure services rather
than end-user devices. If you need to expose OPA on the internet, secure it with
OPA's
[Authentication and Authorization](../../security/#authentication-and-authorization)
features, and consider using Azure's Application Gateway as a reverse proxy.

**Network Security Group (NSG) Rules**: If other services running on Azure need
to access OPA, allow inbound traffic on OPA’s listening port (default `8181`)
within the NSG rules. Restrict the source IP addresses to only those that need
access.

:::info
If OPA only needs to be accessible from within the same VM, configure it to
listen on `localhost` instead of `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) below.
:::


## User Data Script

After selecting the VM specifications, you can use Azure’s user data script
to install and run OPA upon VM startup. This is under the 'Advanced'
tab, if creating a VM through the Azure portal web UI. The script will only
be run after opting to 'Enable user data'.

Using a user data script is recommended approach if you do not have a custom VM
image with OPA pre-installed. This script will:

- Download the OPA binary for the latest release.
- Place the config for the instance in the credstore
- Start OPA using Systemd with this configuration file listening on port `8181`.

Before continuing, please ensure you have the following information:

- Bundle Service Token: <InlineEditable paramKey="token"/> (if the bundle server
  requires a static token, see [configuration](../../configuration) for more
  information).
- OPA Version: <InlineEditable paramKey="version"/>, e.g. `X.Y.Z` not `latest`
  or `vX.Y.Z`. Review the
  [OPA releases](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases) on GitHub.

Please use the user data shell script below to install and run OPA:
