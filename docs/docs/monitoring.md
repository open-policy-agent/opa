## OpenTelemetry

When run as a server and configured accordingly, OPA will emit spans to an
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) collector via gRPC.

Each [REST API](./rest-api/) request sent to the server will start a span.
If processing the request involves policy evaluation, and that in turn uses
[`http.send`](./policy-reference/#http), those HTTP clients will emit descendant spans.

Furthermore, spans exported for policy evaluation requests will contain an
attribute `opa.decision_id` of the evaluation's decision ID _if_ the server
has decision logging enabled.

See [the configuration documentation](./configuration/#distributed-tracing)
for all OpenTelemetry-related configurables.

## Prometheus

OPA exposes an HTTP endpoint that can be used to collect performance metrics
for all API calls. The Prometheus endpoint is enabled by default when you run
OPA as a server.

You can enable metric collection from OPA with the following `prometheus.yml` config:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
- job_name: "opa"
  metrics_path: "/metrics"
  static_configs:
  - targets:
    - "localhost:8181"
```

The Prometheus endpoint exports Go runtime metrics as well as HTTP request latency metrics for all handlers (e.g., `v1/data`).

## Operational Metrics

OPA exposes operational metrics for system monitoring.

### Server and Request Metrics

- `timer_server_handler_ns` - Total time to handle API request
- `timer_server_read_bytes_ns` - Time spent reading request body


### Bundle Management Metrics

- `timer_bundle_request_ns` - Time spent downloading bundles from remote servers
- `timer_rego_load_bundles_ns` - Time to load and activate bundles

Use these to detect slow bundle servers or compilation issues.

### Cache Performance Metrics

- `counter_server_query_cache_hit` - Query results served from cache
- `counter_rego_builtin_http_send_interquery_cache_hits` - HTTP responses served from inter-query cache
- `counter_rego_builtin_http_send_network_requests` - Actual network requests made
- `counter_rego_builtin_glob_interquery_value_cache_hits` - Glob pattern cache hits

### Accessing Metrics

1. **Prometheus endpoint**: `/metrics` - HTTP GET endpoint that exports all metrics in Prometheus format
   - URL: `http://localhost:8181/metrics` (when OPA runs with default settings)
   - Format: Prometheus text format (compatible with Prometheus scrapers)
   - Includes: All timers, counters, histograms, plus Go runtime metrics
2. **Status API**: Includes subset of metrics in status reports
3. **Decision logs**: Can include request-level metrics
4. **Query API**: Add `?metrics=true` to policy evaluation requests

For a complete list of all available metrics, see [Metrics Registry](./metrics-registry).

For policy evaluation metrics, see [Policy Performance](./policy-performance#performance-metrics).

## Health Checks

OPA exposes a `/health` API endpoint that can be used to perform health checks.
See [Health API](./rest-api#health-api) for details.

## Status API

OPA provides a plugin which can push status to a remote service.
See [Status API](./management-status) for details.
