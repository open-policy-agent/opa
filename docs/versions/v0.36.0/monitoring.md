## OpenTelemetry

When run as a server and configured accordingly, OPA will emit spans to an
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) collector via gRPC.

Each [REST API](../rest-api/) request sent to the server will start a span.
If processing the request involves policy evaluation, and that in turn uses
[`http.send`](../policy-reference/#http), those HTTP clients will emit descendant spans.

Furthermore, spans exported for policy evaluation requests will contain an
attribute `opa.decision_id` of the evaluation's decision ID _if_ the server
has decision logging enabled.

See [the configuration documentation](../configuration/#distributed-tracing)
for all OpenTelemetry-related configurables.

## Prometheus

OPA exposes an HTTP endpoint that can be used to collect performance metrics
for all API calls. The Prometheus endpoint is enabled by default when you run
OPA as a server.

You can enable metric collection from OPA with the following `prometheus.yml` config:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "opa"
    metrics_path: "/metrics"
    static_configs:
    - targets:
      - "localhost:8181"
```

The Prometheus endpoint exports Go runtime metrics as well as HTTP request latency metrics for all handlers (e.g., `v1/data`).

## Health Checks

OPA exposes a `/health` API endpoint that can be used to perform health checks.
See [Health API](../rest-api#health-api) for details.

## Status API

OPA provides a plugin which can push status to a remote service.
See [Status API](../management-status) for details.
