# Language Reference

This document is the authoritative specification of the Rego policy language
(V1). All policies in OPA are written in Rego.

## Built-in Functions

The built-in functions for the language provide basic operations to manipulate
scalar values (e.g. numbers and strings), and aggregate functions that summarize
complex types.

For valid patterns, check the table below. Argument ``delimiters`` is an array of single-characters (e.g. `[".", ":"]`). If ``delimiters`` is empty, it defaults to ``["."]``. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``glob.quote_meta(pattern, output)``</span> | 1 | ``output`` is the escaped string of ``pattern``. Calling ``glob.quote_meta("*.github.com", output)`` returns ``\\*.github.com`` as ``output``. |

| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``io.jwt.decode(string, [header, payload, sig])``</span> | 1 | ``header`` and ``payload`` are ``object``. ``signature`` is the hexadecimal representation of the signature on the token. |
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``io.jwt.decode_verify(string, constraints, [valid, header, payload])``</span> | 2 | If the input token verifies and meets the requirements of ``constraints`` then ``valid`` is ``true`` and ``header`` and ``payload`` are objects containing the JOSE header and the JWT claim set. Otherwise, ``valid`` is ``false`` and ``header`` and ``payload`` are ``{}``. |

The input `string` is a JSON Web Token encoded with JWS Compact Serialization. JWE and JWS JSON Serialization are not supported. If nested signing was used, the ``header``, ``payload`` and ``signature`` will represent the most deeply nested token.

For ``io.jwt.decode_verify``, ``constraints`` is an object with the following members:

| Name | Meaning | Required |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| ``cert`` | A PEM encoded certificate containing an RSA or ECDSA public key. | See below |
| ``secret`` | The secret key for HS256, HS384 and HS512 verification. | See below |
| ``alg`` | The JWA algorithm name to use. If it is absent then any algorithm that is compatible with the key is accepted. | Optional |
| ``iss`` | The issuer string. If it is present the only tokens with this issuer are accepted. If it is absent then any issuer is accepted. | Optional |
|``time`` | The time in nanoseconds to verify the token at. If this is present then the ``exp`` and ``nbf`` claims are compared against this value. If it is absent then they are compared against the current time. | Optional |
|``aud`` | The audience that the verifier identifies with.  If this is present then the ``aud`` claim is checked against it. If it is absent then the ``aud`` claim must be absent too. | Optional |

Exactly one of ``cert`` and ``secret`` must be present.
If there are any unrecognized constraints then the token is considered invalid.

| ------- |--------|-------------|
| <span class="opa-keep-it-together">``opa.runtime(output)``</span> | 0 | ``opa.runtime`` returns a JSON object ``output`` that describes the runtime environment where OPA is deployed. **Caution**: Policies that depend on the output of ``opa.runtime`` may return different answers depending on how OPA was started. If possible, prefer using an explicit `input` or `data` value instead of `opa.runtime`. The ``output`` of ``opa.runtime`` will include a ``"config"`` key if OPA was started with a configuration file. The ``output`` of ``opa.runtime`` will include a ``"env"`` key containing the environment variables that the OPA process was started with. |
