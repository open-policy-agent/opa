# Language Reference

This document is the authoritative specification of the Rego policy language
(V1). All policies in OPA are written in Rego.

## Built-in Functions

The built-in functions for the language provide basic operations to manipulate
scalar values (e.g. numbers and strings), and aggregate functions that summarize
complex types.

## Grammar

Rego’s syntax is defined by the following grammar:

```
module          = package { import } policy
package         = "package" ref
import          = "import" package [ "as" var ]
policy          = { rule }
rule            = [ "default" ] rule-head { rule-body }
rule-head       = var [ "(" rule-args ")" ] [ "[" term "]" ] [ = term ]
rule-args       = term { "," term }
rule-body       = [ else [ = term ] ] "{" query "}"
query           = literal { ";" | [\r\n] literal }
literal         = ( expr | "not" expr ) { with-modifier }
with-modifier   = "with" term "as" term
instructions    = expr { ";" | [\r\n] expr }
expr            = term | expr-built-in | expr-infix
expr-built-in   = var [ "." var ] "(" [ term { , term } ] ")"
expr-infix      = [ term "=" ] term infix-operator term
term            = ref | var | scalar | array | object | set | array-compr
array-compr     = "[" term "|" rule-body "]"
set-compr       = "{" term "|" rule-body "}"
object-compr    = "{" object-item "|" rule-body "}"
infix-operator  = bool-operator | arith-operator | bin-operator
bool-operator   = "=" | "!=" | "<" | ">" | ">=" | "<="
arith-operator  = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
bin-operator    = "&" | "|"
ref             = var { ref-arg }
ref-arg         = ref-arg-dot | ref-arg-brack
ref-arg-brack   = "[" ( scalar | var | array | object | set | "_" ) "]"
ref-arg-dot     = "." var
var             = ( ALPHA | "_" ) { ALPHA | DIGIT | "_" }
scalar          = string | NUMBER | TRUE | FALSE | NULL
string          = STRING | raw-string
raw-string      = "`" { CHAR-"`" } "`"
array           = "[" term { "," term } "]"
object          = "{" object-item { "," object-item } "}"
object-item     = ( scalar | ref | var ) ":" term
set             = empty-set | non-empty-set
non-empty-set   = "{" term { "," term } "}"
empty-set       = "set(" ")"
```

The grammar defined above makes use of the following syntax. See [the Wikipedia page on EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_Form) for more details:

```
[]     optional (zero or one instances)
{}     repetition (zero or more instances)
|      alteration (one of the instances)
()     grouping (order of expansion)
STRING JSON string
NUMBER JSON number
TRUE   JSON true
FALSE  JSON false
NULL   JSON null
CHAR   Unicode character
ALPHA  ASCII characters A-Z and a-z
DIGIT  ASCII characters 0-9
```
