    note: |
      Similar to the public [OPA Playground](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/),
      Alfred can be used to learn Rego interactively in an environment that
      can't use the public playground. Read about
      [installation](https://github.com/dolevf/Open-Policy-Agent-Alfred#how-to-install).

Alfred introduces a local graphical user interface to interact with Open Policy Agent and acts as an alternative to OPA's playground, allowing the user to keep information related to policy testing locally.
