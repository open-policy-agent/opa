Principled Evolution uses AICertify to generate the input context about AI systems and Gopal to provide the domain-specific Rego policies. OPA acts as the central decision engine, enabling automated, consistent, and auditable enforcement of AI governance rules via the standard Policy-as-Code approach familiar to the OPA community. This integration brings the power and flexibility of OPA to the critical domain of AI ethics and compliance.
