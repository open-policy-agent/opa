  status-api:
    note: |
      Styra DAS can receive status updates from OPA instances via the status
      API. See the
      [documentation here](https://docs.styra.com/das/policies/policy-organization/systems/view-opa-status)
      for more information.
  envoy:
    note: |
      Styra DAS provides an out-of-the-box integration for writing Envoy
      authorization policies. See the
      [tutorial](https://docs.styra.com/das/systems/envoy/tutorials)
      here.
  policy-testing:
    note: |
      DAS supports the running of tests alongside Rego policy in its UI.
      Read documentation about
      [testing Rego policies in DAS](https://docs.styra.com/das/policies/policy-authoring/test-policies).
  language-tooling:
    note: |
      DAS supports the writing, testing and debugging of Rego policies in a UI.
      Read about

  external-data:
    note: |
      The [Bundle Registry](https://docs.styra.com/das/policies/bundles/bundle-registry)
      feature of DAS uses OPA's Bundle API to distribute policy and data updates to
      OPA instances.
  opa-bundles:
    note: |
      Styra DAS exposes a Bundle Service compatible API to the OPA instances
      that it manages. Delta bundles are also supported. Read the
      [Bundle Registry Docs](https://docs.styra.com/das/policies/bundles/bundle-registry)
      to learn more.
  opa-bundles-discovery:
    note: |
      Styra DAS exposes a Bundle Service compatible API to the OPA instances
      that it manages. Discovery bundles are also supported. Read the

      to learn more.
  terraform:
    note: |
      Styra DAS has native support for the validation of Terraform code and
      plans via a prebuilt 'system-type', this is
      [documented here](https://docs.styra.com/das/systems/terraform/overview).
  kubernetes:
    note: |
      Styra DAS has native support for mutating and validating Kubernetes
      at admission time via a prebuilt 'system-type', this is

    note: |
      Styra DAS can aggregate and index OPA decision logs. Exporting to
      object storage, and Kafka is also supported. View
      [the documentation](https://docs.styra.com/das/observability-and-audit/decision-logs/overview)
      here.
