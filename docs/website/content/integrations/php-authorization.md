    note: |
      This library provides a PHP wrapper around the OPA REST API. It can
      update policies and query for decisions. See the
      [project README](https://github.com/segrax/openpolicyagent)
      for various examples.

These integrations demonstrate using OPA to perform API authorization in PSR-15 and Symfony compliant frameworks.
