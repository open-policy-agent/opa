  learning-rego:
    note: |
      Regal can automatically check for common Rego mistakes as you code.
      Each violation is accompanied by a detailed explanation which can be a
      great learning tool for new Rego users. See the
      [Supported Rules](https://github.com/StyraInc/regal/tree/main#rules).
  go-integration:
    note: |
      Regal is built using the Go Rego API. Regal evaluates linting rules
      defined in Rego against the Rego AST of policy files. The
      [linter package](https://github.com/StyraInc/regal/blob/main/pkg/linter/linter.go)
      is a good place to see how OPA is used in the project.
  policy-testing:
    note: |
      Regal is a useful step to use when testing Rego policies to ensure
      code is correct and free of common errors. See
      [the README](https://github.com/StyraInc/regal#try-it-out)
      to get started.
  debugging-rego:
    note: |
      Regal can be used to debug Rego policies by identifying common mistakes.
      See [Bugs](https://docs.styra.com/regal/category/bugs) for some example
      issues it can identify automatically.
