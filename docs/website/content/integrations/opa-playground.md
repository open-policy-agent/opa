  learning-rego:
    note: |
      Sometimes if you're working on a Rego policy in an integrated system
      it can help to debug it in isolation first. The playground is a great
      place to do that. Get started with a [hello world example](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/).
  language-tooling:
    note: |
      The playground is a great place to get started with writing and testing
      your first policies. You can also share links if you're asking for
      help in the community Slack. Get started with a simple
      [RBAC example](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/p/Bb9FqBvauC).
