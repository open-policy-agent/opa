# Integration Index

The integration index makes it easy to find either a specific integration with OPA 
or to browse the integrations with OPA within a particular category.  And it pulls 
information about that integration (e.g. blogs, videos, tutorials, code) into a 
single place while allowing integration authors to maintain the code wherever they like.  

# Schema

The schema of integrations.yaml has the following highlevel entries, each of which is self-explanatory.
* integrations
* organizations
* software

Each entry is an object where keys are unique identifiers for each subentry.  
Organizations and Software are self-explanatory by inspection.  The schema for integrations is as follows.

* title: string
* description: string
* software: array of strings
* labels: collection of key/value pairs.
* tutorials: array of links
* code: array of links
* inventors: array of either
  * string (organization name)
  * object with fields
    * name: string
    * organization: string
* videos: array of either
  * link
  * object with fields
    * title: string
    * speakers: array of name/organization objects
    * venue: string
    * link: string
* blogs: array of links


In the near future this data will be used to produce a GUI for perusing integrations.  The plan is to use the 
following labels to generate categories of integrations.

* layer: which layer of the stack does this belong to
* category: which kind of component within that layer is this
* type: what kind of integration this is.  Either `enforcement` or `poweredbyopa`.  `enforcement` is the default 
  if `type` is missing.  `poweredbyopa` is intended to be integrations built using OPA that are not tied to a 
  particular layer of the stack.  This distinction is the most ambiguous and may change.
