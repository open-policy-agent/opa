  kubernetes-authorization:
    title: Kubernetes Authorization
    description: |
      Kubernetes Authorization is a pluggable mechanism that lets administrators control which users can run which APIs and
      is often handled by builtin RBAC.  OPA's policy language is more flexible than the RBAC, for example,
      writing policy using a prohibited list of APIs instead of the usual RBAC style of listing the permitted APIs.

      OPAL brings open-policy up to the speed needed by live applications. As your application state changes (whether it's via your APIs, DBs, git, S3 or 3rd-party SaaS services), OPAL will make sure your services are always in sync with the authorization data and policy they need (and only those they need).
