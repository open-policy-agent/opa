    title: OPAL
    subtitle: Open Policy Administration Layer
    description:  |
      OPAL is an administration layer for Open Policy Agent (OPA), detecting changes in realtime to both policy and policy data and pushing live updates to your agents.
      OPAL brings open-policy up to the speed needed by live applications. As your application state changes (whether it's via your APIs, DBs, git, S3 or 3rd-party SaaS services), OPAL will make sure your services are always in sync with the authorization data and policy they need (and only those they need).
