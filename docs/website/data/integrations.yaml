  kubernetes-authorization:
    title: Kubernetes Authorization
    description: |
      Kubernetes Authorization is a pluggable mechanism that lets administrators control which users can run which APIs and
      is often handled by builtin RBAC.  OPA's policy language is more flexible than the RBAC, for example,
      writing policy using a prohibited list of APIs instead of the usual RBAC style of listing the permitted APIs.

      Application require authorization decisions made at the API gateway, frontend, backend, and database.
      OPA helps developers decouple authorization logic from application code, define a custom authorization model
      that enables end-users to control tenant permissions, and enforce that policy across the different components of the
      application (gateway, frontend, backend, database).
