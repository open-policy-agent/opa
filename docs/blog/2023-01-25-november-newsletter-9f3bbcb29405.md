### Policy as Code with Open Policy Agent — Anders Eknert, Styra

Should user Alice be allowed to read credit reports? Should a cloud instance be deployable without basic security configuration in place? Should service X be allowed to query the database? Policy defines the rules of our systems, but how do we ensure our policies are enforced consistently in increasingly distributed and diverse tech stacks? In this talk we'll explore the benefits of decoupling policy from our applications, deployment pipelines and platforms, and how Open Policy Agent (OPA) can help unify the way we work with policy across the stack.

### Securing kubernetes with opa and gatekeeper

Starts at 3:23:20 as part of the Kubehuddle Edinburgh event.
